        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia poses significant challenges for emergency department (ED) care, as persons living with dementia (PLWD) more frequently experience adverse outcomes such as delirium, prolonged stays, and higher mortality rates. Despite advancements in care strategies, a critical gap remains in understanding how ED interventions impact outcomes in this vulnerable population. This systematic review aims to identify evidence-based ED care interventions tailored to PLWD to improve outcomes.\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library (Wiley), Scopus (Elsevier), and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global through September 2024. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024586555). Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and quality improvement initiatives focused on ED interventions for PLWD. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. Outcomes included patient satisfaction, ED revisits, functional decline, and mortality.\nRESULTS: From 3305 screened studies, six met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g., music and light therapy), specialized geriatric ED units, and assessment tools, such as for pain. Tailored interventions including geriatric emergency units and community paramedic care transitions were effective in reducing 30-day ED revisits and hospitalizations. However, heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes precluded meta-analysis. Risk of bias ranged from low to moderate.\nCONCLUSION: This review underscores the urgent need for standardized and evidence-based interventions in ED settings for PLWD. Approaches including multidisciplinary care models and nonpharmacologic therapies demonstrated potential for improving outcomes. Future research should prioritize consistent outcome measures, interdisciplinary collaboration, and person-centered care strategies to enhance the quality and equity of ED services for PLWD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inclisiran administration twice-yearly (after initial and 3-month doses) effectively reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients on maximally tolerated statins with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), risk equivalents, or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.\nOBJECTIVES: In this study, the authors sought to evaluate whether inclisiran is superior as monotherapy over placebo and ezetimibe in reducing LDL-C in a primary prevention population without ASCVD.\nMETHODS: VICTORION-Mono (V-Mono), a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo- and active-comparator controlled phase 3 trial, assessed inclisiran monotherapy in adult participants (aged 18-75 years) without prior ASCVD, diabetes, or familial hypercholesterolemia, with a fasting LDL-C of 100-190 mg/dL and 10-year predicted ASCVD risk of <7.5% according to pooled cohort equation, who were not receiving any lipid-lowering therapy. Participants were randomized (2:1:1) to inclisiran, ezetimibe, or placebo. The primary endpoint was percentage change in LDL-C from baseline, and key secondary endpoints included absolute change in LDL-C and percentage change in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) from baseline to day 150. The study did not evaluate twice-yearly inclisiran dosing beyond the first 180 days. Safety was also assessed.\nRESULTS: Overall, 350 participants were randomized (n = 174, 89, and 87 to inclisiran, ezetimibe, or placebo, respectively) and received the assigned treatments. The study included a diverse population: 62.6% of participants were female, 10.6% were Black or African American, and 39.7% were Hispanic/Latino. Mean participant age was 46.1 years, mean baseline LDL-C level was 135.4 mg/dL, mean body mass index was 29.8 kg/m2, and median 10-year predicted ASCVD risk score was 2.2%. The mean percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at day 150 for placebo was 1.4%, for ezetimibe -11.2%, and inclisiran -46.5%. The difference in the change from baseline with inclisiran vs placebo was -47.9% and vs ezetimibe was -35.4% (both P < 0.0001). Inclisiran treatment also demonstrated favorable improvements in other lipid and lipoprotein(a) levels. Inclisiran was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns.\nCONCLUSIONS: V-Mono demonstrates for the first time that in patients not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, inclisiran as monotherapy, is superior to both placebo and ezetimibe in reducing LDL-C levels over a 6-month follow-up period and was well tolerated. These findings are consistent with previous observations in statin-treated patients.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Music medicine has shown promise in reducing anxiety and pain during medical procedures, but its effects during interventional pain procedures without sedation remain unexplored. Although previous studies have examined music medicine with procedural sedation, to our knowledge, no published research has yet explored music medicine during procedures without sedation in the chronic pain population, underscoring the novelty of our investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of music medicine on pain intensity, unpleasantness, and anxiety during lumbar medial branch blocks (LMBB) performed without sedation.\nMETHODS: This prospective, randomized controlled trial included 150 patients undergoing first-time LMBB. Participants were randomized to either a music medicine group (n=74) or a control group (n=76). Primary outcomes were changes in pain scores before and after the procedure. Secondary outcomes included changes in patient anxiety, satisfaction, hemodynamic parameters, pain catastrophizing, and progression to radiofrequency ablation.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in postprocedure pain intensity (p=0.32) or unpleasantness (p=0.4) between groups. However, the music medicine group showed a significant reduction in anxiety scores (p=0.049), particularly in patients with higher baseline Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores. No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic parameters, patient satisfaction, or desire for repeat procedures between groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: While music medicine during LMBB did not significantly impact pain intensity or unpleasantness, it demonstrated a notable reduction in patient anxiety, especially in those with higher pain catastrophizing tendencies. These findings suggest that music medicine may be a valuable, nonpharmacological intervention for managing anxiety during interventional pain procedures.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An interim analysis of progression-free survival in this trial showed that ibrutinib-venetoclax was superior to fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Whether ibrutinib-venetoclax is more effective than ibrutinib alone is unclear.\nMETHODS: In this phase 3, multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with CLL to receive ibrutinib-venetoclax, ibrutinib alone, or FCR. The primary end points were undetectable measurable residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow within 2 years in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group as compared with the ibrutinib-alone group and progression-free survival in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group as compared with the FCR group. A powered secondary end point was progression-free survival in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group as compared with the ibrutinib-alone group. Other secondary end points included overall survival.\nRESULTS: A total of 172 of the 260 participants (66.2%) in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group had undetectable MRD in bone marrow within 2 years, as compared with none of the 263 participants in the ibrutinib-alone group (P<0.001) and 127 of the 263 participants (48.3%) in the FCR group. With a median follow-up of 62.2 months, disease progression or death occurred in 18 participants (6.9%) in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group, as compared with 59 (22.4%) in the ibrutinib-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 0.49; P<0.001) and 112 (42.6%) in the FCR group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.21; P<0.001). Progression-free survival at 5 years was 93.9% with ibrutinib-venetoclax, 79.0% with ibrutinib alone, and 58.1% with FCR. Death occurred in 11 participants (4.2%) in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group, as compared with 26 (9.9%) in the ibrutinib-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.83) and 39 (14.8%) in the FCR group (hazard ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.50). Sudden death occurred in 3, 8, and 4 participants in the ibrutinib-venetoclax, ibrutinib-alone, and FCR groups, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: With extended follow-up and increased enrollment, our trial showed that undetectable MRD and extended progression-free survival were more common with ibrutinib-venetoclax than with ibrutinib alone or FCR. The results for overall survival were also consistent with a benefit of ibrutinib-venetoclax.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To provide evidence-based recommendations for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\nMETHODS: An Expert Panel including patient representation completed a systematic review of the evidence and made recommendations.\nRESULTS: Depending upon prior treatment received, androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs: enzalutamide, abiraterone with prednisone), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), chemotherapeutic agents (docetaxel, cabazitaxel), radiopharmaceuticals (radium 223, 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen [PSMA]-617), and sipuleucel-T have demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with mCRPC. For patients with BRCA1/2 alterations who did not receive prior ARPI, the combination of PARPi and ARPI (talazoparib + enzalutamide, olaparib and/or niraparib + abiraterone) has shown clinical benefit. For patients with BRCA1/2 alterations who received prior ARPI or ARPI followed by docetaxel, olaparib showed OS benefit. In select patients with microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient, pembrolizumab showed clinical efficacy.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Prior systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer will determine subsequent therapy used for mCRPC. Continue androgen-deprivation therapy for patients with mCRPC indefinitely. Early adoption of somatic genetic testing and palliative care is recommended. Patients with mCRPC and bony metastases should receive a bone-protective agent. The panel recommends the combination of ARPI with PARPi in patients with BRCA1/2 alterations who did not receive prior ARPI. For patients who received prior ARPI, the panel recommends docetaxel chemotherapy. The panel recommends 177Lu-PSMA-617 or cabazitaxel chemotherapy for patients who receive prior ARPI and docetaxel chemotherapy. For patients with BRCA1/2 alterations who received prior ARPI, the panel recommends PARPi monotherapy. Radium 223 is recommended for patients with symptomatic bone-only disease. Evidence for optimal sequencing for mCRPC regimens is lacking.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/genitourinary-cancer-guidelines.",
