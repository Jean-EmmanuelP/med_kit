=== Abstract ===
AIM
: To assess the association between new-onset atrial fibrillation and dementia among patients with type 2 diabetes, a group with a high prevalence of atrial fibrillation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
: This cohort study included 22 989 patients with type 2 diabetes from the UK Biobank. New-onset atrial fibrillation was ascertained from hospital admission records. We used an algorithm officially released by the UK Biobank to identify all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The algorithm was developed using multiple sources, including hospital admissions and the death registry. Time-varying Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between new-onset atrial fibrillation and dementia.
RESULTS
: A total of 2843 participants developed atrial fibrillation, whereas the remaining 20 146 did not. During the median of 12.3 years of follow-up, 844 all-cause dementia, 342 Alzheimer's disease and 246 vascular dementia cases occurred. Compared with participants without atrial fibrillation, those with atrial fibrillation had higher risks of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80-2.57), Alzheimer's disease (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.96) and vascular dementia (HR 3.11, 95% CI 2.32-4.17).
CONCLUSIONS
: New-onset atrial fibrillation was associated with a substantially higher risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our findings highlight the significance of atrial fibrillation management in mitigating the risk of dementia in this demographic.
