=== Abstract ===
IMPORTANCE
: Bipolar mania is a common disabling illness. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for patients with severe mania, though it is limited by the risk of cognitive adverse effects. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) as an alternative treatment to ECT for bipolar mania has not yet been reported.
OBJECTIVE
: To compare the effectiveness and cognitive adverse effects of MST and ECT in bipolar mania.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Shanghai Mental Health Center from July 1, 2017, through April 26, 2021. Forty-eight patients with bipolar mania were recruited and randomly allocated to receive MST or ECT. The data analysis was performed from June 5, 2021, through August 30, 2023.
INTERVENTIONS
: Patients completed 2 or 3 sessions of MST or ECT per week for a total of 8 to 10 sessions. The MST was delivered at 100% device output with a frequency of 75 Hz over the vertex.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
: The primary outcomes were reduction of total Young Manic Rating Scale (YMRS) score and response rate (more than 50% reduction of the total YMRS score compared with baseline). An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and repeated-measures analyses of variance were conducted for the primary outcomes.
RESULTS
: Twenty patients in the ECT group (mean [SD] age, 31.6 [8.6] years; 12 male [60.0%]) and 22 patients in the MST group (mean [SD] age, 34.8 [9.8] years; 15 male [68.2%]) were included in the ITT analysis. The response rates were 95.0% (95% CI, 85.4%-100%) in the ECT group and 86.4% (95% CI, 72.1%-100%) in the MST group. The YMRS reduction rate (z = -0.82; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.10; P = .41) and response rate (?2 = 0.18; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.31; P = .67) were not significantly different between the groups. The time-by-group interaction was significant for the language domain (F1,24 = 7.17; P = .01), which was well preserved in patients receiving MST but worsened in patients receiving ECT. No serious adverse effects were reported in either group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
: These findings suggest that MST is associated with a high response rate and fewer cognitive impairments in bipolar mania and that it might be an alternative therapy for the treatment of bipolar mania.
