=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: The use of quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has been increasing since 2014. Studies have shown that QT is comparable to hamstring tendon (HT) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autografts in terms of outcomes, although QT autograft has lower rates of donor site morbidity. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been previously conducted on this topic, although none have focused solely on data of patients at least 5 years out from surgery.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE
: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to demonstrate that QT may not be superior to BTB and HT autografts and that long-term studies must be performed before recommending QT over other graft choices. It was hypothesized that there would be less available data at =5 years of follow-up for patients with QT than those with HT and BTB autografts, and that patient-reported outcomes would be similar between all 3 graft choices.
STUDY DESIGN
: Meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 4.
METHODS
: The PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus (Elsevier), Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were queried for studies that reported on QT, BTB, or HT outcomes at =5 years after ACL reconstruction (ACLR). In total, 27 studies were included; patient and outcome data were collected from each. Summary odds ratios were calculated for each outcome and compared between all graft types.
RESULTS
: The sheer volume of available patient data on QT autografts at =5 years after ACLR is vastly different from what is available on HT and BTB autografts (which have almost 3 times the amount of patient data as compared with QT). HT had the highest failure rate (12.7%), followed by QT (9.1%) and BTB (6.4%); summary odds ratios favored BTB over both QT and HT in terms of failure rate. Patient-reported outcomes were comparable between graft types, although some comparisons were not adequately powered.
CONCLUSION
: This meta-analysis reveals critical information on the current state of the literature surrounding QT use in ACLR. Most notably, additional mid-term and long-term patient data are needed on those undergoing ACLR with QT autograft. There is not enough long-term outcome data on QT to recommend it over HT or BTB for primary ACLR.
