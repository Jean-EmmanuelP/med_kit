=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Despite being recognized as a safe procedure with minimal reported complications, injecting autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) as an adjuvant to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) for symptomatic patients with meniscal tears and concomitant knee osteoarthritis (OA) has not been studied in randomized controlled trials.
PURPOSE
: To compare patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) scores and radiographic outcomes in symptomatic patients with meniscal tears and concomitant mild knee OA who underwent APM with and without an autologous BMAC injection administered at the time of surgery.
STUDY DESIGN
: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
METHODS
: Enrolled patients aged =18 years determined to have a symptomatic meniscal tear with concomitant mild knee OA suitable for APM and meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized into 2 groups: BMAC and control (no BMAC). The primary endpoint of the study was the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 1 year postoperatively. Secondary endpoints included radiographic outcomes (Kellgren-Lawrence grade) at 1 year postoperatively and various PROM scores, including those for the IKDC, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog scale, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey, at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after meniscectomy.
RESULTS
: Of the 95 enrolled patients, 83 (87.4%) were included for final analysis. No significant differences were found between the groups with regard to patient characteristics, intraoperative variables, concomitant procedures, preoperative PROM scores, or preoperative radiographic findings. At 1 year postoperatively, the BMAC group failed to demonstrate significantly better IKDC scores (P = .687) or radiographic outcomes (P > .05 for all radiographic measures) compared with the control group. Secondary PROM scores also did not significantly differ between the groups (P > .05 for all PROMs). However, there were higher achievement rates of the minimal clinically important difference for the KOOS Sport (100.0% vs 80.0%, respectively; P = .023) and KOOS Symptoms (92.3% vs 68.0%, respectively; P = .038) at 1 year postoperatively in the BMAC group than in the control group. All PROMs, excluding the VR-12 mental score, showed significant improvements compared with baseline at all postoperative time points for both the BMAC and control groups.
CONCLUSION
: The addition of an autologous BMAC injection during APM did not result in significant changes in IKDC scores or radiographic outcomes at the 1-year postoperative mark. Secondary PROM scores were generally comparable between the 2 groups, but there was higher minimal clinically important difference achievement for the KOOS Sport and KOOS Symptoms at 1 year postoperatively in the BMAC group. In patients with symptoms consistent with a meniscal tear who had concomitant mild OA, the addition of BMAC to arthroscopic debridement did not affect the outcome.
