=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Second-generation highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) has revolutionized total hip arthroplasty. However, the long-term risks and benefits of HXLPE in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain unknown. This randomized clinical trial evaluated implant survivorship, complications, radiographic results, and clinical outcomes of HXLPE and conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) inserts in primary TKAs.
METHODS
: We enrolled 518 patients (518 knees) who underwent primary TKA in 3 centers within 1 tertiary referral network. The mean age was 67 years, the mean body mass index was 32 kg/m 2 , and 58% of the patients were women. All of the patients underwent primary TKA with a cemented posterior-stabilized tibial insert and patellar resurfacing. Randomization proceeded via stratified dynamic allocation. The patients were blinded to their study group allocation: those in the control group (254 knees) underwent TKA with an UHMWPE insert (N2Vac; Stryker); those in the treatment group (264 knees) received an HXLPE insert (X3; Stryker). Kaplan-Meier survivorship, radiographic results, and clinical outcomes were assessed. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. The mean follow-up was 11 years.
RESULTS
: The 10-year overall survivorship free from any revision and from any reoperation was 96% and 94%, respectively. There were no differences in the risk of revision or reoperation between the groups (p > 0.05). There were a total of 19 revisions. Revision indications included periprosthetic joint infection (14 knees), instability (4 knees), and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a patellar fracture due to osteolysis around a UHMWPE insert (1 knee). There were no revisions due to polyethylene wear, osteolysis, or fracture of the post in the HXLPE group. The radiographic results and clinical outcomes were otherwise similar.
CONCLUSIONS
: Notably, no wear-related failures were identified in the HXLPE group, but there was 1 case of osteolysis in the UHMWPE group.
