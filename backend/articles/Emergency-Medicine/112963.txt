=== Abstract ===
STUDY OBJECTIVE
: We propose a novel method of evaluating right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in the emergency department (ED) using RV "bubble time"-the duration of time bubbles from a saline solution flush are visualized in the RV on echocardiography. The objective was to identify the optimal cutoff value for RV bubble time that differentiates patients with RV dysfunction and report on its diagnostic test characteristics.
METHODS
: This prospective diagnostic accuracy study enrolled a convenience sample of hemodynamically stable patients in the ED. A sonographer administered a 10-mL saline solution flush into the patient's intravenous catheter, performed a bedside echocardiogram, and measured RV bubble time. Subsequently, the patient underwent a comprehensive cardiologist-interpreted echocardiogram within 36 hours, which served as the gold standard. Patients with RV strain or enlargement of the latter found on an echocardiogram were considered to have RV dysfunction. Bubble time was evaluated by a second provider, blinded to the initial results, who reviewed the ultrasound clips. The primary outcome measure was the optimal cutoff value of RV bubble time that identifies patients with and without RV dysfunction.
RESULTS
: Of 196 patients, median age was 67 year, and half were women, with 69 (35.2%) having RV dysfunction. Median RV bubble time among patients with RV dysfunction was 62 seconds (interquartile range [IQR]: 52, 93) compared with 21 seconds (IQR: 12, 32) among patients without (P<.0001). The optimal cutoff value of RV bubble time for identifying patients with RV dysfunction was 40 or more seconds, with a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.00) and specificity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.93).
CONCLUSION
: In patients in the ED, an RV bubble time of 40 or more seconds had high sensitivity in identifying patients with RV dysfunction, whereas an RV bubble time of less than 40 seconds had good specificity in identifying patients without RV dysfunction. These findings warrant further investigation in undifferentiated patient populations and by emergency physicians without advanced ultrasound training.
