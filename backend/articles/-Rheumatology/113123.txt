=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: To summarise current data regarding the use of imaging in crystal-induced arthropathies (CiAs) informing a European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology task force.
METHODS
: We performed four systematic searches in Embase, Medline and Central on imaging for diagnosis, monitoring, prediction of disease severity/treatment response, guiding procedures and patient education in gout, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPPD) and basic calcium phosphate deposition (BCPD). Records were screened, manuscripts reviewed and data of the included studies extracted. The risk of bias was assessed by validated instruments.
RESULTS
: For gout, 88 studies were included. Diagnostic studies reported good to excellent sensitivity and specificity of dual-energy CT (DECT) and ultrasound (US), high specificity and lower sensitivity for conventional radiographs (CR) and CT. Longitudinal studies demonstrated sensitivity to change with regard to crystal deposition by US and DECT and inflammation by US and structural progression by CR and CT. For CPPD, 50 studies were included. Diagnostic studies on CR and US showed high specificity and variable sensitivity. There was a single study on monitoring, while nine assessed the prediction in CPPD. For BCPD, 56 studies were included. There were two diagnostic studies, while monitoring by CR and US was assessed in 43 studies, showing a reduction in crystal deposition. A total of 12 studies with inconsistent results assessed the prediction of treatment response. The search on patient education retrieved two studies, suggesting a potential role of DECT.
CONCLUSION
: This SLR confirmed a relevant and increasing role of imaging in the field of CiAs.
