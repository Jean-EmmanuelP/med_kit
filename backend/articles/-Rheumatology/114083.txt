=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVES
: Disease activity control in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with corticosteroid and immunosuppressant withdrawal is a treatment goal. We evaluated whether this could be attained with sequential subcutaneous belimumab (BEL) and one cycle of rituximab (RTX).
METHODS
: In this phase 3, double-blind BLISS-BELIEVE trial (GSK Study 205646), patients with active SLE initiating subcutaneous BEL 200 mg/week for 52 weeks were randomised to intravenous placebo (BEL/PBO) or intravenous RTX 1000 mg (BEL/RTX) at weeks 4 and 6 while stopping concomitant immunosuppressants/tapering corticosteroids; standard therapy for 104 weeks (BEL/ST; reference arm) was included.
PRIMARY ENDPOINT
: proportion of patients achieving disease control (SLE Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) =2; without immunosuppressants; prednisone equivalent =5 mg/day) at week 52 with BEL/RTX versus BEL/PBO. Major (alpha-controlled) secondary endpoints: proportion of patients with clinical remission (week 64; clinical SLEDAI-2K=0, without immunosuppressants/corticosteroids); proportion of patients with disease control (week 104). Other assessments: disease control duration, anti-dsDNA antibody, C3/C4 and B cells/B-cell subsets.
RESULTS
: The modified intention-to-treat population included 263 patients. Overall, 16.7% (12/72) of BEL/PBO and 19.4% (28/144) of BEL/RTX patients achieved disease control (OR (95% CI) 1.27 (0.60 to 2.71); p=0.5342) at week 52. For major secondary endpoints, differences between BEL/RTX and BEL/PBO were not statistically significant. Anti-dsDNA antibodies and most assessed B cells/B-cell subsets were lower with BEL/RTX versus BEL/PBO. Mean disease control duration through 52 weeks was significantly greater with BEL/RTX versus BEL/PBO.
CONCLUSIONS
: BEL/RTX showed no superiority over BEL/PBO for most endpoints analysed; however, it led to significant improvements in disease activity markers compared with BEL/PBO. Further investigation of combination treatment is warranted.
