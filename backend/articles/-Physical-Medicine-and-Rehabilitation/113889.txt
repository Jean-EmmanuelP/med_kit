=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVES
: To (1) examine the effects of home-based balance training on balance and mobility outcomes; (2) evaluate comparable effects between home- and center-based balance training; (3) determine the effects of different levels of supervision on treatment effects; and (4) investigate dose-response relationships of home-based balance training on balance and mobility performance in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).
DATA SOURCES
: Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SPORTSDiscus, and CINAHL in April 2023. Other literature sources included website and citation searches.
STUDY SELECTION
: The study included randomized controlled trials of home-based balance training that included balance and mobility outcomes in persons with MS.
DATA EXTRACTION
: Data extracted from each study included (1) number of participants; (2) dropout rate; (3) sex; (4) MS phenotype; (5) age; (6) Expanded Disability Status Scale (range); (7) exercise dose; (8) level of supervision; (9) type of intervention; (10) exercise progression; (11) type of control; and (12) outcomes measures. For the meta-analysis, mean and SD of the balance and mobility outcomes in both the intervention and control groups were used. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated by Tool for the Assessment of Study Quality and Reporting in Exercise.
DATA SYNTHESIS
: Eleven studies were identified in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Each balance and mobility outcome was standardized using Hedges' g.
CONCLUSIONS
: This meta-analysis revealed comparable results between home- and center-based balance training in terms of balance and mobility improvement. There was also no evidence for the superiority of home-based balance training over no training except for static steady-state balance. This study revealed that training sessions (>36 sessions) and total exercise time (>1100min) were significant moderators for overall balance improvements. Results also indicated that, when designing future interventions, at least an indirect level of supervision (eg, weekly or biweekly phone/video calls) is warranted to maintain adherence.
