=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy in treating upper limb spasticity after a stroke.
DESIGN
: Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING
: Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University.
SUBJECTS
: This study included 95 people with stroke.
INTERVENTION
: The active (n = 47) and sham-placebo (n = 48) radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy groups received three treatment sessions (every third day).
MAIN MEASURES
: The Modified Ashworth Scale, Hmax/Mmax ratio, root mean square, co-contraction ratio, mechanical parameters of the muscle and temperature were measured at baseline and days 2, 5 and 8.
RESULTS
: Among the 135 potential participants screened, 100 were enrolled and allocated randomly, with 95 participants ultimately being included in the intent-to-treat analysis dataset. The active group showed significantly better improvements in upper limb spasticity and muscle function than did the sham-placebo group. Greater improvements in the Modified Ashworth Scale were observed in the active group than in the sham-placebo group (difference, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.22; P < 0.001). Moreover, significant differences in root mean square, co-contraction ratio and Hmax/Mmax ratio were observed between the two groups (all P < 0.001). The mechanical parameters of the biceps muscle were significantly better in the active group than in the sham-placebo group (P < 0.001). The active group had a higher temperature than the sham-placebo group, although the difference was not significant (P = 0.070).
CONCLUSIONS
: This study revealed that the treatment with extracorporeal shockwave therapy can relieve upper limb spasticity in people with stroke.
