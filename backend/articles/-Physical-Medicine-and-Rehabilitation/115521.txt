=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of using a robotic exoskeletal hand (RMT) combined with mirror therapy (MT) in hand rehabilitation for poststroke patients, compared to conventional MT.
DESIGN
: Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING
: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic.
PARTICIPANTS
: Forty poststroke subjects.
INTERVENTIONS
: Participants were divided into 2 groups: one received robotic exoskeletal hand therapy combined with mirror therapy (RMT+MT), and the other received conventional MT. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
: Hand motor function abilities were assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremities (FMA-UE)-Hand Motor Domain, and finger dexterity was evaluated with the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT).
RESULTS
: The RMT group showed significant improvement in hand motor function, with a median FMA-UE-Hand Motor Domain score increasing from 6 to 14 (P=.000). Finger dexterity also improved significantly in the RMT group (P=.000). The conventional MT group demonstrated significant improvements in both the FMA-UE-Hand Motor Domain (P=.001) and NHPT (P=.000). However, the RMT group achieved greater improvements, with significant differences between the 2 groups in both FMA-UE-Hand Motor Domain (P=.038) and NHPT (P=.026) scores.
CONCLUSIONS
: RMT is significantly more effective in restoring hand motor skills and improving finger dexterity in patients with poststroke rehabilitation compared to conventional MT.
