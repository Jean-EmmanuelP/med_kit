=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on functional exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), respiratory muscle function, and pulmonary function in individuals with ischemic heart disease (IHD).
METHODS
: The MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, CINAHL, Science Direct, and CENTRAL electronic databases were searched in January 2023. Randomized controlled trials published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that were conducted to determine the effect of RMT versus passive control and/or sham RMT on the target variables in individuals with IHD, irrespective of age or sex were included. Two reviewers performed the searches and extraction of the most relevant data. The quality and risk of bias for each included study were examined with the PEDro scale and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.
RESULTS
: Thirteen studies (849 participants) were included. The meta-analysis showed a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption (mean difference [MD] = 2.18 mL·kg-1·min-1 [95% CI = 0.54 to 3.83]), inspiratory muscle strength (MD = 16.62 cm H2O [95% CI = 12.48 to 20.77]), inspiratory muscle endurance (standardized mean difference = 0.39 [95% CI = 0.19 to 0.60]), and expiratory muscle strength (MD = 14.52 cm H2O [95% CI = 5.51 to 23.53]). There were no benefits in 6-minute walking distance (MD = 37.57 m [95% CI = -36.34 to 111.48]), HRQoL (standardized mean difference = 0.22 [95% CI = -0.16 to 0.60]), pulmonary function (forced vital capacity; MD = 2.07% of predicted value [95% CI = -0.90 to 5.03], or forced expiratory volume at the first second (MD = -0.75% of predicted value [95% CI = -5.45 to 3.95]).
CONCLUSION
: This meta-analysis provided high- and moderate-quality evidence that inspiratory muscle training (IMT) improves inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, respectively; and very low-quality evidence for effects on peak oxygen consumption and expiratory muscle strength in individuals with IHD. No superior effects were found in the 6-minute walking test, HRQoL, or pulmonary function compared with the control group.
IMPACT
: The results shown in this systematic review with meta-analysis will provide clinicians a better understanding of the effects of IMT in people with IHD. IMT could be integrated into the cardiac rehabilitation management, although more research is needed.
