=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: To compare the effectiveness of I-tape and button hole kinesio taping (KT) techniques added to exercises in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
DESIGN
: Prospective randomized controlled blinded study.
SETTING
: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic.
PARTICIPANTS
: A total of 108 patients (165 wrists) diagnosed with CTS (N=108).
INTERVENTIONS
: Button hole technique (BG), I-band technique (IG), and exercises (EG).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
: Visual analog scale (VAS), Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions (DN4), Boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire, and Jamar dynamometer were used. Median sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), median distal sensory latency (DSL), median distal motor latency (DML), sensory conduction velocity, and motor conduction velocity were recorded. Measurements were made at baseline, week 3, and week 12.
RESULTS
: Thirty-six patients were in each group. Significant statistical improvements in VAS and DN4 scores were found in the BG and IG compared with EG (P<.05). Statistically significant improvements in hand grip strength were observed in the IG compared with the EG (P<.05). Significant improvements in DML levels and motor conduction velocity were observed in the BG and IG compared with the EG (P<.05). A significant increase in sensory conduction velocity was detected in the BG compared with the other groups (P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS
: Both KT techniques are effective in terms of pain, functionality, symptom severity, grip strength, and electrophysiologically. The button hole technique was more effective in DSL, sensory conduction velocity, CMAP amplitude, and SNAP.
