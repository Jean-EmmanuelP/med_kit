=== Abstract ===
PURPOSE
: To provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in the multidisciplinary management of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPC).
METHODS
: ASCO convened a multidisciplinary Expert Panel to evaluate the evidence and formulate recommendations. The literature search included studies published between January 1, 2002, and August 31, 2024, and comprised systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. Outcomes of interest include overall and disease-free survival, functional outcomes, and quality of life. Expert Panel members used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.
RESULTS
: A total of 58 publications were identified to inform the evidence base for this guideline.
RECOMMENDATIONS
: Evidence-based recommendations address the evaluation and workup of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive OPC, the role of TORS, patient selection, adjuvant therapy, HPV-negative OPC, and use of TORS in salvage or recurrent setting.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/head-neck-cancer-guidelines.
