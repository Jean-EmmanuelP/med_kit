=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: The efficacy and safety of adjunctive statin therapy in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remains uncertain.
METHODS
: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to late April 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing statin versus no statin use in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) applying a random-effects model. R version 4.3.1 was used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS
: We included 7 RCTs comprising 4,262 patients, of whom 2,645 (62%) were randomized to receive statin therapy. Compared with no statin, statin use significantly reduced case-fatality rate (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80-0.98; I2 = 0%). In a time-to-event analysis, we found similar results (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75-0.99; I2 = 0%). Statin use also significantly reduced World Health Organization (WHO) scale at 14 days (mean difference -0.27; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.01; I2 = 0%). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay, elevation of liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS
: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, statins significantly reduced case-fatality rate and WHO scale score.
REGISTRATION
: A prospective register was recorded in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the number CRD42023479007.
