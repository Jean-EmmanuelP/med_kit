=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia during pregnancy causes maternal, fetal, and infant mortality. Poor pregnancy outcomes are related to blood-stage parasite sequestration and the ensuing inflammatory response in the placenta, which decreases over successive pregnancies. A radiation-attenuated, non-replicating, whole-organism vaccine based on P falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Vaccine) has shown efficacy at preventing infection in African adults. Here, we aimed to examine vaccine safety and efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine in adults and women who anticipated conception.
METHODS
: Two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (phase 1 MLSPZV3 and phase 2 MLSPZV4) were conducted at a clinical research centre in Mali. MLSPZV3 included adults aged 18-35 years and MLSPZV4 included non-pregnant women aged 18-38 years who anticipated conception within a year of enrolment. In MLSPZV3, participants were stratified by village and randomly assigned (2:1) using block randomisation to receive three doses of 9 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine or saline placebo at weeks 0, 1, and 4 (4-week schedule) or at weeks 0, 8, and 16 (16-week schedule) and a booster dose around 1 year later. In MLSPZV4, women received presumptive artemether-lumefantrine twice per day for 3 days 2 weeks before dose one and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using block randomisation to receive three doses of 9 × 105 or 1·8 × 106 PfSPZ Vaccine or saline placebo all administered at weeks 0, 1, and 4 (4-week schedule). Participants in both studies received artemether-lumefantrine 2 weeks before dose three and additionally 2 weeks before dose four (booster dose) in MLSPZV3. Investigators and participants were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome, assessed in the as-treated population, was PfSPZ Vaccine safety and tolerability within 7 days after each dose. The secondary outcome, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, was vaccine efficacy against P falciparum parasitaemia (defined as the time-to-first positive blood smear) from dose three until the end of transmission season. In exploratory analyses, MLSPZV4 evaluated incidence of maternal obstetric and neonatal outcomes as safety outcomes, and vaccine efficacy against P falciparum parasitaemia during pregnancy (defined as time-to-first positive blood smear post-conception). In MLSPZV4, women were followed at least once a month with human chorionic gonadotropin testing, and those who became pregnant received standard of care (including intermittent presumptive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine antimalarial drugs after the first trimester) during routine antenatal visits. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03510481 and NCT03989102.
FINDINGS
: Participants were enrolled for vaccination during the onset of malaria seasons for two sequential studies conducted from 2018 to 2019 for MLSPZV3 and from 2019 to 2021 for MLSPZV4, with follow-up during malaria seasons across 2 years. In MLSPZV3, 478 adults were assessed for eligibility, of whom 220 were enrolled between May 30 and June 12, 2018, and then between Aug 13 and Aug 18, 2018, and 210 received dose one. 66 (96%) of 69 participants who received the 16-week schedule and 68 (97%) of 70 who received the 4-week schedule of the 9 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine and 70 (99%) of 71 who received saline completed all three doses in year 1. In MLSPZV4, 407 women were assessed for eligibility, of whom 324 were enrolled from July 3 to July 27, 2019, and 320 received dose one of presumptive artemether-lumefantrine. 300 women were randomly assigned with 100 per group (PfSPZ Vaccine 9 × 105, 1·8 × 106, or saline) receiving dose one. First trimester miscarriages were the most commonly reported serious adverse event but occurred at a similar rate across study groups (eight [15%] of 54 with 9 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine, 12 [21%] of 58 with 1·8 × 106 PfSPZ Vaccine, and five [12%] of 43 with saline). One unrelated maternal death occurred 425 days after the last vaccine dose in the 1·8 × 106 PfSPZ Vaccine group due to peritonitis shortly after childbirth. Most related adverse events reported in MLSPZV3 and MLSPZV4 were mild (grade 1) and frequency of adverse events in the PfSPZ Vaccine groups did not differ from that in the saline group. Two unrelated serious adverse events occurred in MLSPZV3 (one participant had appendicitis in the 9 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine group and the other in the saline group died due to a road traffic accident). In MLSPZV3, the 9 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine did not show vaccine efficacy against parasitaemia with the 4-week (27% [95% CI -18 to 55] in year 1 and 42% [-5 to 68] in year 2) and 16-week schedules (16% [-34 to 48] in year 1 and -14% [-95 to 33] in year 2); efficacies were similar or worse against clinical malaria compared with saline. In MLSPZV4, the PfSPZ Vaccine showed significant efficacy against parasitaemia at doses 9 × 105 (41% [15 to 59]; p=0·0069 in year 1 and 61% [36 to 77]; p=0·0011 in year 2) and 1·8 × 106 (54% [34 to 69]; p<0·0001 in year 1 and 45% [13 to 65]; p=0·029 in year 2); and against clinical malaria at doses 9 × 105 (47% [20 to 65]; p=0·0045 in year 1 and 56% [22 to 75]; p=0·0081 in year 2) and 1·8 × 106 (48% [22 to 65]; p=0·0013 in year 1 and 40% [2 to 64]; p=0·069 in year 2). Vaccine efficacy against post-conception P falciparum parasitaemia during first pregnancies that arose in the 2-year follow-up was 57% (14 to 78; p=0·017) in the 9 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine group versus 49% (3 to 73; p=0·042) in the 1·8 × 106 PfSPZ Vaccine group. Among 55 women who became pregnant within 24 weeks after dose three, vaccine efficacy against parasitaemia was 65% (23 to 84; p=0·0088) with the 9 × 105 PfSPZ Vaccine and 86% (64 to 94; p<0·0001) with the 1·8 × 106 PfSPZ Vaccine. When combined in a post-hoc analysis, women in the PfSPZ Vaccine groups had a non-significantly reduced time-to-first pregnancy after dose one compared with those in the saline group (log-rank test p=0·056). Exploratory maternal obstetric and neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly between vaccine groups and saline.
INTERPRETATION
: PfSPZ Vaccine was safe and well tolerated in adults in Mali. The 9 × 105 and 1·8 × 106 doses of PfSPZ Vaccine administered as per the 4-week schedule, which incorporated presumptive antimalarial treatment before the first vaccine dose, showed significant efficacy against P falciparum parasitaemia and clinical malaria for two malaria transmission seasons in women of childbearing age and against pregnancy malaria. PfSPZ Vaccine without presumptive antimalarial treatment before the first vaccine dose did not show efficacy.
