=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Iron and folic acid supplementation have been recommended in pregnancy for anaemia prevention, and may improve other maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.
OBJECTIVES
: To examine the effects of daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy, either alone or in combination with folic acid or with other vitamins and minerals, as an intervention in antenatal care.
SEARCH METHODS
: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Registry on 18 January 2024 (including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, conference proceedings), and searched reference lists of retrieved studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA
: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials that evaluated the effects of oral supplementation with daily iron, iron + folic acid, or iron + other vitamins and minerals during pregnancy were included.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
: Review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, ascertained trustworthiness based on pre-defined criteria, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and conducted checks for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for primary outcomes. We anticipated high heterogeneity amongst trials; we pooled trial results using a random-effects model (average treatment effect).
MAIN RESULTS
: We included 57 trials involving 48,971 women. A total of 40 trials compared the effects of daily oral supplements with iron to placebo or no iron; eight trials evaluated the effects of iron + folic acid compared to placebo or no iron + folic acid. Iron supplementation compared to placebo or no iron Maternal outcomes: Iron supplementation during pregnancy may reduce maternal anaemia (4.0% versus 7.4%; risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.47; 14 trials, 13,543 women; low-certainty evidence) and iron deficiency at term (44.0% versus 66.0%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.68; 8 trials, 2873 women; low-certainty evidence), and probably reduces maternal iron-deficiency anaemia at term (5.0% versus 18.4%; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63; 7 trials, 2704 women; moderate-certainty evidence), compared to placebo or no iron supplementation. There is probably little to no difference in maternal death (2 versus 4 events, RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.69; 3 trials, 14,060 women; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for adverse effects (21.6% versus 18.0%; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.02; 12 trials, 2423 women; very low-certainty evidence) and severe anaemia (Hb < 70 g/L) in the second/third trimester (< 1% versus 3.6%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.20; 8 trials, 1398 women; very low-certainty evidence). No trials reported clinical malaria or infection during pregnancy. Infant outcomes: Women taking iron supplements are probably less likely to have infants with low birthweight (5.2% versus 6.1%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99; 12 trials, 18,290 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), compared to placebo or no iron supplementation. However, the evidence is very uncertain for infant birthweight (MD 24.9 g, 95% CI -125.81 to 175.60; 16 trials, 18,554 infants; very low-certainty evidence). There is probably little to no difference in preterm birth (7.6% versus 8.2%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02; 11 trials, 18,827 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in neonatal death (1.4% versus 1.5%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24; 4 trials, 17,243 infants; low-certainty evidence) or congenital anomalies, including neural tube defects (41 versus 48 events; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.33; 4 trials, 14,377 infants; low-certainty evidence). Iron + folic supplementation compared to placebo or no iron + folic acid Maternal outcomes: Daily oral supplementation with iron + folic acid probably reduces maternal anaemia at term (12.1% versus 25.5%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64; 4 trials, 1962 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce maternal iron deficiency at term (3.6% versus 15%; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.99; 1 trial, 131 women; low-certainty evidence), compared to placebo or no iron + folic acid. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of iron + folic acid on maternal iron-deficiency anaemia (10.8% versus 25%; RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.09; 1 trial, 131 women; very low-certainty evidence), or maternal deaths (no events; 1 trial; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain for adverse effects (21.0% versus 0.0%; RR 44.32, 95% CI 2.77 to 709.09; 1 trial, 456 women; low-certainty evidence), and the evidence is very uncertain for severe anaemia in the second or third trimester (< 1% versus 5.6%; RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.63; 4 trials, 506 women; very low-certainty evidence), compared to placebo or no iron + folic acid. Infant outcomes: There may be little to no difference in infant low birthweight (33.4% versus 40.2%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.74; 2 trials, 1311 infants; low-certainty evidence), comparing iron + folic acid supplementation to placebo or no iron + folic acid. Infants born to women who received iron + folic acid during pregnancy probably had higher birthweight (MD 57.73 g, 95% CI 7.66 to 107.79; 2 trials, 1365 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), compared to placebo or no iron + folic acid. There may be little to no difference in other infant outcomes, including preterm birth (19.4% versus 19.2%; RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.00; 3 trials, 1497 infants; low-certainty evidence), neonatal death (3.4% versus 4.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.30; 1 trial, 1793 infants; low-certainty evidence), or congenital anomalies (1.7% versus 2.4; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.40; 1 trial, 1652 infants; low-certainty evidence), comparing iron + folic acid supplementation to placebo or no iron + folic acid. A total of 19 trials were conducted in malaria-endemic countries, or in settings with some malaria risk. No studies reported maternal clinical malaria; one study reported data on placental malaria.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
: Daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy may reduce maternal anaemia and iron deficiency at term. For other maternal and infant outcomes, there was little to no difference between groups or the evidence was uncertain. Future research is needed to examine the effects of iron supplementation on other maternal and infant health outcomes, including infant iron status, growth, and development.
