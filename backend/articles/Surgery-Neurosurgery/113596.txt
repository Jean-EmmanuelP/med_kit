=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Positive susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke has been associated with friable red blood cell-rich clots and more effective recanalisation using stent retrievers versus contact aspiration. We compared the safety and efficacy of stent retrievers plus contact aspiration (combined technique) versus contact aspiration alone as the first-line thrombectomy technique in patients with acute ischaemic anterior circulation stroke and SVS-positive occlusions.
METHODS
: Adaptive Endovascular Strategy to the Clot MRI in Large Intracranial Vessel Occlusion (VECTOR) was a prospective, randomised, open-label study with blinded evaluation. Patients with SVS-positive anterior circulation occlusions on pretreatment MRI and arterial puncture within 24 h of symptom onset were enrolled from 22 centres in France. A centralised web-based method was used by interventional neuroradiologists for dynamic randomisation by minimisation. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the combined technique or contact aspiration alone. The primary outcome was expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) grade 2c or 3 reperfusion after three or fewer passes on post-treatment angiogram, adjudicated by a blinded independent central imaging core laboratory. The intention-to-treat population was used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04139486) and is complete.
FINDINGS
: Between Nov 26, 2019, and Feb 14, 2022, 526 patients were enrolled, of whom 521 constituted the intention-to-treat population (combined technique, n=263; contact aspiration alone, n=258). The median age of participants was 74·9 years (IQR 64·4-83·3); 284 (55%) were female and 237 (45%) male. The primary outcome did not differ significantly between groups (152 [58%] of 263 patients for the combined technique vs 135 [52%] of 258 for contact aspiration; odds ratio [OR] 1·27; 95% CI 0·88-1·83; p=0·19). Procedure-related adverse events occurred in 32 (12%) of 263 patients in the combined technique group and 27 (11%) of 257 in the contact aspiration group (OR 1·14; 0·65-2·00; p=0·65). The most common adverse event was intracerebral haemorrhage (146 [56%] of 259 patients for the combined technique vs 123 [49%] of 251 for contact aspiration; OR 1·32; 0·91-1·90; p=0·13). All-cause mortality at 3 months occurred in 57 (23%) of 251 patients in the combined technique group and 48 (19%) of 247 in the contact aspiration group (OR 1·19; 0·76-1·86; p=0·45), none of which was treatment-related.
INTERPRETATION
: The results of the VECTOR trial do not show superiority of the combined stent retriever plus contact aspiration technique over contact aspiration alone in patients with SVS-positive occlusion with respect to achieving eTICI 2c-3 within three passes. These findings support the use of either the combined technique or contact aspiration alone as the initial thrombectomy strategy in patients with acute anterior circulation stroke with SVS on pretreatment MRI.
