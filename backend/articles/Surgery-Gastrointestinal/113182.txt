=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: To compare intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, blood loss, renal function, and duration of surgery with and without temporary portocaval shunt (TPCS) in live donor liver transplantation (LT) recipients. Secondary objectives were postoperative early graft dysfunction, morbidity, mortality, total intensive care unit, and hospital stay.
BACKGROUND
: Blood loss during recipient hepatectomy for LT remains a major concern. Routine use of TPCS during LT is not yet elucidated.
METHODS
: This study is a single-center, open-label, randomized control trial. The sample size was calculated based on intraoperative blood loss. After exclusion, a total of 60 patients, 30 in each arm (TPCS vs no TPCS) were recruited in the trial.
RESULTS
: The baseline recipient and donor characteristics were comparable between the groups. The median intraoperative blood loss ( P = 0.004) and blood product transfusions ( P < 0.05) were significantly less in the TPCS group. The TPCS group had significantly improved intraoperative hemodynamics in the anhepatic phase as compared with the no TPCS group ( P < 0.0001), requiring significantly less vasopressor support. This led to significantly better renal function as evidenced by higher intraoperative urine output in the TPCS group ( P = 0.002). Because of technical simplicity, the TPCS group had significantly fewer inferior vena cava injuries (3.3 vs 26.7%, P = 0.026) and substantially shorter hepatectomy time and total duration of surgery (529.4 ± 35.54 vs 606.83 ± 48.13 min, P < 0.0001). The time taken for normalization of lactate in the immediate postoperative period was significantly shorter in the TPCS group (median, 6 vs 13 h; P = 0.04). Although postoperative endotoxemia, major morbidity, 90-day mortality, total intensive care unit, and hospital stay were comparable between both groups, tolerance to enteral feed was earlier in the TPCS group.
CONCLUSIONS
: In live donor LT, TPCS is a simple and effective technique that provides superior intraoperative hemodynamics and reduces blood loss and duration of surgery.
