=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: No randomized controlled trials have substantiated endoscopic decompression of the pancreatic duct in patients with painful chronic pancreatitis.
OBJECTIVE
: To investigate the pain-relieving effect of pancreatic duct decompression in patients with chronic pancreatitis and intraductal stones.
DESIGN
: 24-week, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03966781).
SETTING
: Asian Institute of Gastroenterology in India from February 2021 to July 2022.
PARTICIPANTS
: 106 patients with chronic pancreatitis.
INTERVENTION
: Combined extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) compared with sham procedures.
MEASUREMENTS
: The primary end point was pain relief on a 0- to 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were assessed after 12 and 24 weeks and included 30% pain relief, opioid use, pain-free days, questionaries, and complications to interventions.
RESULTS
: 52 patients in the ESWL/ERP group and 54 in the sham group were included. At 12 weeks, the ESWL/ERP group showed better pain relief compared with the sham group (mean difference in change, -0.7 [95% CI, -1.3 to 0] on the VAS; P = 0.039). The difference between groups was not sustained at the 24-week follow-up, and no differences were seen for 30% pain relief at 12- or 24-week follow-up. The number of pain-free days was increased (median difference, 16.2 days [CI, 3.9 to 28.5 days]), and the number of days using opioids was reduced (median difference, -5.4 days [CI, -9.9 to -0.9 days]) in the ESWL/ERP group compared with the sham group at 12-week follow-up. Safety outcomes were similar between groups.
LIMITATION
: Single-center study and limited duration of follow-up.
CONCLUSION
: In patients with chronic pancreatitis and intraductal stones, ESWL with ERP provided modest short-term pain relief.
