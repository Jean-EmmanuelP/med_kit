=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: Early hypoglycaemia at the time of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission is common in very/extreme preterm infants. This study aimed to determine whether buccal dextrose gel in the delivery room (DR) would improve rates of early hypoglycaemia in this population.
DESIGN
: Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING
: Four level-3 and one level-2 neonatal units.
PATIENTS
: Inborn infants=32+0 weeks gestational age (GA).
INTERVENTIONS
: Infants were randomised to 40% dextrose or placebo gel in the DR (=29+0 GA: 0.5 mL gel, =29+1 GA: 1 mL gel).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
: Hypoglycaemia (<1.8 mmol/L) measured at the time of first intravenous access at NICU admission.
RESULTS
: Between November 2020 and August 2022, the recruitment rate was slow (impacted by the requirement for antenatal consent). This fact, coupled with finite research resources, led to a decision to end recruitment early. Data analysis of 169 newborns (33% of target sample size) showed no significant difference in the frequency of the primary outcome between dextrose 24/84 (29%) and placebo 25/85 (29%) groups (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.86; p=0.88). A post-hoc analysis indicated that the trial had a low (47% conditional power) chance of detecting a statistically significant benefit from the intervention (had the target sample been achieved).
CONCLUSIONS
: This study showed no evidence of benefit of 40% dextrose gel on rates of hypoglycaemia at NICU admission. Management of these vulnerable newborns should continue to focus on vascular access and commencement of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids as early as possible.
