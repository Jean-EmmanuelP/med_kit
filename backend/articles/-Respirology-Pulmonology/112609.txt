=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: The effectiveness of BCG vaccine for adult pulmonary tuberculosis remains uncertain. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of vaccination with BCG-Denmark to prevent initial and sustained interferon-? release assay conversion in Brazilian health-care workers.
METHODS
: This substudy is a nested randomised controlled trial embedded within the BRACE trial (NCT04327206). Specifically, this substudy enrolled Brazilian health-care workers (aged =18 years) from three sites in Brazil (Manaus, Campo Grande, and Rio de Janeiro) irrespective of previously receiving BCG vaccination. Participants were excluded if they had contraindications to BCG vaccination, more than 1 month of treatment with specific tuberculosis treatment drugs, previous adverse reactions to BCG, recent BCG vaccination, or non-compliance with assigned interventions. Those eligible were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the BCG group (0·1 mL intradermal injection of BCG-Denmark [Danish strain 1331; AJ Vaccines, Copenhagen]) or the placebo group (intradermal injection of 0·9% saline) using a web-based randomisation process in variable-length blocks (2, 4, or 6), and were stratified based on the study site, age (<40, =40 to <60, =60 years), and comorbidity presence (diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cardiac condition, hypertension). Sealed syringes were used to prevent inadvertent disclosure of group assignments. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) Plus test (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany) was used for baseline and 12-month tuberculosis infection assessments. The primary efficacy outcome was QFT Plus conversion (=0·35 IU/mL) by 12 months following vaccination in participants who had a negative baseline result (<0·35 IU/mL).
FINDINGS
: Between Oct 7, 2020, and April 12, 2021, 1985 (77·3%) of 2568 participants were eligible for QFT Plus assessment at 12 months and were included in this substudy; 996 (50·2%) of 1985 were in the BCG group and 989 (49·8%) were in the placebo group. Overall, 1475 (74·3%) of 1985 participants were women and 510 (25·7%) were men, and the median age was 39 years (IQR 32-47). During the first 12 months, QFT Plus conversion occurred in 66 (3·3%) of 1985 participants, with no significant differences by study site (p=0·897). Specifically, 34 (3·4%) of 996 participants had initial QFT conversion in the BCG group compared with 32 (3·2%) of 989 in the placebo group (risk ratio 1·09 [95% CI 0·67-1·77]; p=0·791).
INTERPRETATION
: BCG-Denmark vaccination did not reduce initial QFT Plus conversion risk in Brazilian health-care workers. This finding underscores the need to better understand tuberculosis prevention in populations at high risk.
