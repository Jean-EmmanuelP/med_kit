=== Abstract ===
PURPOSE
: This multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical trial (Northern Radiation Oncology Group of China-002) focused on patients with oligo-organ metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. We aimed to investigate whether first-line concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), compared with TKIs alone, could achieve better survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
: The patients in the TKI plus TRT group received 60 Gy to primary lung tumor and positive regional lymph nodes. Radiotherapy for metastases to other sites was determined by clinicians. The primary end point was the progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The first and second interim analyses were performed in March 2021 and March 2022.
RESULTS
: Between April 14, 2016, and February 25, 2022, a total of 118 patients were enrolled. Compared with the TKI alone group, the TKI plus TRT group achieved significantly better PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; P = .004) and OS (HR, 0.62; P = .029). The median PFS was 10.6 months in the TKI alone group and 17.1 months in the TKI plus TRT group. The median OS was 26.2 months and 34.4 months in the TKI alone group and TKI plus TRT group, respectively. The TKI plus TRT group showed better local control but was associated with a higher incidence of severe TRAEs (11.9% v 5.1%).
CONCLUSION
: For patients with EGFR-mutated oligo-organ metastatic NSCLC treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs, concurrent TRT improves the PFS and OS, and TRAEs are acceptable and tolerable.
