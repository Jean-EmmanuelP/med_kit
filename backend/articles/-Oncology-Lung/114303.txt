=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Adjuvant therapy with durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, may have efficacy in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer who do not have disease progression after standard concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS
: In a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients to receive durvalumab at a dose of 1500 mg, durvalumab (1500 mg) plus tremelimumab at a dose of 75 mg (four doses only), or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 24 months. Randomization was stratified according to disease stage (I or II vs. III) and receipt of prophylactic cranial irradiation (yes vs. no). Results of the first planned interim analysis of the two primary end points of overall survival and progression-free survival (assessed on the basis of blinded independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1) with durvalumab as compared with placebo (data cutoff date, January 15, 2024) are reported; results in the durvalumab-tremelimumab group remain blinded.
RESULTS
: A total of 264 patients were assigned to the durvalumab group, 200 to the durvalumab-tremelimumab group, and 266 to the placebo group. Durvalumab therapy led to significantly longer overall survival than placebo (median, 55.9 months [95% confidence interval {CI}, 37.3 to not reached] vs. 33.4 months [95% CI, 25.5 to 39.9]; hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 98.321% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P = 0.01), as well as to significantly longer progression-free survival (median 16.6 months [95% CI, 10.2 to 28.2] vs. 9.2 months [95% CI, 7.4 to 12.9]; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.76; 97.195% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P = 0.02). The incidence of adverse events with a maximum grade of 3 or 4 was 24.4% among patients receiving durvalumab and 24.2% among patients receiving placebo; adverse events led to discontinuation in 16.4% and 10.6% of the patients, respectively, and led to death in 2.7% and 1.9%. Pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis with a maximum grade of 3 or 4 occurred in 3.1% of the patients in the durvalumab group and in 2.6% of those in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS
: Adjuvant therapy with durvalumab led to significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo among patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer. (Funded by AstraZeneca; ADRIATIC ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03703297.).
