=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Cadonilimab is a bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, which has shown substantial clinical benefits in advanced cervical cancer. In the COMPASSION-16 trial, we aimed to evaluate the addition of cadonilimab to first-line standard chemotherapy in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer.
METHODS
: In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, women aged 18-75 years across 59 clinical sites in China with previously untreated persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive cadonilimab (10 mg/kg) or placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab every 3 weeks for six cycles, followed by maintenance therapy every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Randomisation was performed centrally through an interactive web-response system. Stratification factors were the use of bevacizumab (yes or no) and previous concurrent chemoradiotherapy (yes or no). The dual primary outcomes were progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review and overall survival in the full analysis set. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04982237; the study has completed enrolment and is ongoing for treatment and follow-up.
FINDINGS
: 445 eligible women were enrolled between Sept 11, 2021, and June 23, 2022. Median progression-free survival was 12·7 months (95% CI 11·6-16·1) in the cadonilimab group and 8·1 months (7·7-9·6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·62 [95% CI 0·49-0·80], p<0·0001); median overall survival was not reached (27·0 months to not estimable) versus 22·8 months (17·6-29·0), respectively (hazard ratio 0·64 [0·48-0·86], p=0·0011). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were decreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood cell count, and anaemia.
INTERPRETATION
: The addition of cadonilimab to first-line standard chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival with a manageable safety profile in participants with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. The data support the use of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy as an efficacious first-line therapy in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer.
