=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: To compare active with passive voiding trials on the rate of passing a trial of void and discharge rates with catheter in women who have undergone midurethral sling for treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
DATA SOURCES
: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through February 24, 2023.
METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION
: Our population included women undergoing midurethral sling, with or without anterior or posterior repair, for treatment of SUI. Our two primary outcomes were rate of passing voiding trial and rate of discharge with a catheter. Our secondary outcome was the rate of delayed postoperative urinary retention, when a patient initially passes a trial of void but then subsequently presents in retention.
TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS
: Abstracts were doubly screened; full-text articles were doubly screened; and accepted articles were doubly extracted. In single-arm studies evaluating either passive or active voiding trial, random-effects meta-analyses of pooled proportions were used to assess outcomes. Of 3,033 abstracts screened, 238 full-text articles were assessed, and 26 met inclusion criteria. Ten studies including 1,370 patients reported active trial of void. Sixteen studies including 3,643 patients reported passive trial of void. We included five randomized controlled trials, five comparative retrospective studies, five prospective single group studies, and 11 retrospective single group studies. Five of the studies included patients with a concomitant anterior or posterior colporrhaphy. On proportional meta-analysis, the active trial of void group was less likely to pass the voiding trial (81.0%, 95% CI, 0.76-0.87% vs 89.0%, 95% CI, 0.84-0.9%3, P =.029) with high heterogeneity ( I2 =93.0%). Furthermore, there were more discharges with catheter in active trial of void compared with passive trial of void (19.0%, 95% CI, 0.14-0.24% vs 7.0%, 95% CI, 0.05-0.10%, P <.01). The rates of delayed postoperative urinary retention were low and not different between groups (0.6%, 95% CI, 0.00-0.02% vs 0.2%, 95% CI, 0.00-0.01%, P =.366) with low heterogeneity ( I2 =0%). Sling revisions were statistically lower in the active trial of void group (0.5%, 95% CI, 0.00-0.01% vs 1.5%, 95% CI, 0.01-0.02%, P =.035) with low heterogeneity ( I2 =10.4%).
CONCLUSION
: Passive trial of void had higher passing rates and lower discharge with catheter than active trial of void. Rates of most complications were low and similar between both groups, although passive trial of void had higher sling revisions.
