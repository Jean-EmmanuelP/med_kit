=== Abstract ===
PURPOSE
: Caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumors (PMBT) experience significant psychological distress. We assessed the effect of a psychological intervention (NeuroCARE) on anxiety symptoms among PMBT caregivers.
METHODS
: We conducted a randomized trial of NeuroCARE versus usual care in PMBT caregivers with elevated anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score =5) within 6 months of the patient's diagnosis. NeuroCARE was developed for PMBT caregivers and consists of six telehealth sessions with a behavioral health specialist. Participants completed surveys at baseline, 11-week (postintervention), and 16-week (1-month postintervention) time points. The primary outcome was 11-week anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]-Anxiety Subscale). We also measured depression symptoms (HADS-Depression Subscale), quality of life (QOL; Caregiver QOL survey), caregiver burden (Caregiver Reaction Assessment), self-efficacy (Lewis Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale), coping (Measure of Current Status), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5). We conducted analysis of covariance and linear mixed-effects regression analyses to examine intervention effects on study outcomes.
RESULTS
: We enrolled 120 caregivers (60/group) between October 2019 and June 2022; 105 were evaluable for the primary outcome. At 11 weeks, NeuroCARE participants reported significantly lower anxiety symptoms than usual care participants (M, 8.87 v 10.69; P = .008). NeuroCARE caregivers also reported significantly lower depression symptoms (M, 6.08 v 7.77; P = .004), and better self-efficacy (M, 128.81 v 111.17; P < .001) and coping (M, 32.25 v 25.65; P < .001) at 11 weeks. Study groups did not differ significantly in 11-week QOL, caregiver burden, or PTSD symptoms. In longitudinal analyses, intervention effects on depression symptoms, self-efficacy, and coping were sustained.
CONCLUSION
: A novel, population-specific psychological intervention led to improved anxiety and depression symptoms, self-efficacy, and coping among PMBT caregivers.
