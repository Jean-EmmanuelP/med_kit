=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
: Limited data exist on the safety of IV thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) after dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of idarucizumab pretreatment in patients with AIS receiving IVT.
METHODS
: A national registry-based study evaluated the safety and efficacy of IVT in this specific subgroup. We also conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies and case series, aiming to document the pooled rates of (1) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), (2) any intracranial hemorrhage, (3) 3-month mortality, and (4) the proportion of excellent (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores 0-1) and (5) good (mRS scores 0-2) functional outcome at 3 months among patients with AIS, who received IVT after dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab. Moreover, we sought to compare these outcomes between IVT-treated patients after dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab and IVT-treated patients without dabigatran pretreatment.
RESULTS
: Thirteen cohorts including our nation-wide registry-based cohort and 1 case series comprising 553 patients with AIS (mean age: 75 years; male sex: 65%; median baseline NIH Stroke Scale score: 11 points) receiving idarucizumab before IVT were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled rate of sICH after IVT after idarucizumab administration was 4% (95% CI 1-9; I2 = 26%), while the pooled rates of any intracranial hemorrhage and 3-month mortality were 10% (95% CI 5-16; I2 = 24%) and 18% (95% CI 10-27; I2 = 0%), respectively. The pooled rates of excellent and good functional outcomes at 3 months were 56% (95% CI 27-83; I2 = 69%) and 70% (95% CI 57-81; I2 = 40%), respectively. The risk of sICH (risk ratio [RR] 1.86; 95% CI 0.91-3.80; I2 = 0%), any intracranial hemorrhage (RR 1.76; 95% CI 0.99-3.11; I2 = 8%), and 3-month mortality (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.91-2.48; I2 = 0%) did not differ between patients with AIS receiving IVT with and without idarucizumab. Moreover, idarucizumab administration was associated with higher likelihood of achieving a 3-month good functional outcome (RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.11-1.65; I2 = 27%).
DISCUSSION
: IVT for AIS after dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab seems to be safe and effective in observational studies with limited number of patients. Randomized-controlled clinical trials are warranted to provide robust evidence on the safety and efficacy of IVT in this specific AIS subgroup.
