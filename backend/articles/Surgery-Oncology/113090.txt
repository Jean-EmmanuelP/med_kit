=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation for treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS
: This single-centre RCT was conducted at a tertiary referral centre in China. Patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma who had a single nodule no larger than 5 cm, or up to three nodules of 3 cm or smaller, were eligible. Patients were assigned randomly in a 1 : 1 ratio to either laparoscopic liver resection or radiofrequency ablation. Blinding was not attempted. Sample size calculations led to 75 patients per group. The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was recurrence-free survival.
RESULTS
: Seventy-five patients were included in each group. Overall survival (HR 1.26, 95% c.i. 0.69 to 2.30; P = 0.451) and recurrence-free survival (HR 1.34, 0.86 to 2.08; P = 0.189) did not differ between the resection and ablation groups. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 94.7, 80.0, and 74.7% respectively after laparoscopic liver resection versus 93.3, 78.7, and 67.9% after radiofrequency ablation. Corresponding recurrence-free survival rates were 78.7, 61.3, and 51.6%, and 69.3, 53.3, and 41.0%, respectively.
CONCLUSION
: For small hepatocellular carcinoma, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation provides therapeutic effects similar to those of laparoscopic liver resection.
