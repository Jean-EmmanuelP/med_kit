=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: To assess the effectiveness of indocyanine green (ICG)-guided lymph node (LN) dissection during laparoscopic radical gastrectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC).
BACKGROUND
: Studies on ICG imaging use in patients with LAGC on NAC are rare.
METHODS
: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (clinical T2-4NanyM0) who received NAC were randomly assigned to receive ICG-guided laparoscopic radical gastrectomy or laparoscopic radical gastrectomy alone. Here, we reported the secondary endpoints including the quality of lymphadenectomy (total retrieved LNs and LN noncompliance) and surgical outcomes.
RESULTS
: Overall, 240 patients were randomized. Of whom, 236 patients were included in the primary analysis (118 in the ICG group and 118 in the non-ICG group). In the ICG group, the mean number of LNs retrieved was significantly higher than in the non-ICG group within the D2 dissection (48.2 vs 38.3, P < 0.001). The ICG fluorescence guidance significantly decreased the LN noncompliance rates (33.9% vs 55.1%, P = 0.001). In 165 patients without baseline measurable LNs, ICG significantly increased the number of retrieved LNs and decreased the LN noncompliance rate ( P < 0.05). For 71 patients with baseline measurable LNs, the quality of lymphadenectomy significantly improved in those who had a complete response ( P < 0.05) but not in those who did not ( P > 0.05). Surgical outcomes were comparable between the groups ( P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS
: ICG can effectively improve the quality of lymphadenectomy in patients with LAGC who underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy after NAC.
