=== Abstract ===
During intensive and long-lasting treatments, short-term or emergency care, children often undergo minor needle-related procedures (ie, venepuncture, venous cannulation and puncture of central venous access ports). The use of topical analgesia topical analgesia before these procedures can reduce needle-related pain. There is, however, uncertainty about the type of local anaesthetic (ie, eutectic mixture of topical analgesia (EMLA) or tetracaine-containing creams (eg, Rapydan) that should be used.Therefore, a clinical practice guideline (CPG) was developed to establish a comprehensive, evidence-based overview and provide recommendations for clinical practice.A comprehensive multidisciplinary panel was assembled, comprising 16 professionals and patient representatives in the Netherlands. A systematic literature review was performed, and after dual appraisal of all articles, results were extracted and meta-analyses were performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to assess, extract and summarise the evidence. An in-person meeting was held to discuss the evidence, complete an evidence-to-decision framework and formulate recommendations.In total, ten randomised controlled trials comprising 1808 children formed the evidence base for the recommendations. We recommend the use of EMLA in children who need to undergo a minor needle-related procedure, with minimal application duration of 60 min (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest the use of tetracaine-containing creams only when rapid cannulation/puncture (ie, within 30-60 min) is required (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence).In this CPG, we provide recommendations regarding the choice of local anaesthetic for needle-induced pain during minor procedures in children. With these recommendations, we aim to reduce procedural pain and thereby contribute to improving care for children.
