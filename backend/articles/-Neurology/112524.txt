=== Abstract ===
IMPORTANCE
: Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large-vessel occlusion (LVO), but optimal post-EVT blood pressure (BP) control remains debated.
OBJECTIVE
: To assess the association of different systolic BP targets following EVT with functional outcomes, mortality, and complications in patients with AIS due to LVO.
DATA SOURCES
: Systematic review and meta-analysis of databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) to September 8, 2023.
STUDY SELECTION
: Inclusion criteria consisted of randomized clinical trials examining post-EVT management of systolic BP in patients with AIS and LVO comparing intensive vs conventional targets. Nonrandomized studies, observational studies, noninterventional trials, meeting abstracts, duplicate studies, studies with overlapping data, and non-English language studies were excluded. Two authors independently applied these criteria through a blinded review, with discrepancies resolved through consensus. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the revised tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS
: This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Three authors extracted data regarding study characteristics, baseline patient data, and outcomes of interest. The pooled data were analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
: Rates of functional independence, 90-day mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and hypotensive events.
RESULTS
: A total of 4 randomized clinical trials with 1571 initially enrolled patients were included in the analysis. Lower functional independence rates were observed in the intensive control group (relative risk [RR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98]). No significant differences were found in 90-day mortality (RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.92-1.52]), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.75-1.67]), or hypotensive events (RR, 1.80 [95% CI, 0.37-8.76]). There was minimal heterogeneity among the studies included in the functional independence outcome (I2 = 13% and t2 = 0.003), which was absent among other outcomes (I2 = 0 and t2 = 0).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
: These findings suggest that intensive post-EVT BP reduction does not yield benefits and may carry risks. While awaiting the results of additional ongoing trials, a conservative BP management strategy after endovascular recanalization is favored in daily practice.
