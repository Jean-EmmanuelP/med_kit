=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Obesity is a key factor in the development and progression of both heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). In the STEP-HFpEF Program (comprising the STEP-HFpEF [Research Study to Investigate How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure and Obesity] and STEP-HFpEF DM [Research Study to Look at How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure, Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes] trials), once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg improved HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function and reduced body weight in patients with obesity-related HFpEF. Whether the effects of semaglutide in this patient group differ in participants with and without AF (and across various AF types) has not been fully examined.
OBJECTIVES
: The goals of this study were: 1) to evaluate baseline characteristics and clinical features of patients with obesity-related HFpEF with and without a history of AF; and 2) to determine if the efficacy of semaglutide across all key trial outcomes are influenced by baseline history of AF (and AF types) in the STEP-HFpEF Program.
METHODS
: This was a secondary analysis of pooled data from the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials. Patients with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction =45%, body mass index =30 kg/m2, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) <90 points were randomized 1:1 to receive once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo for 52 weeks. Dual primary endpoints (change in KCCQ-CSS and percent change in body weight), confirmatory secondary endpoints (change in 6-minute walk distance; hierarchical composite endpoint comprising all-cause death, HF events, thresholds of change in KCCQ-CSS, and 6-minute walk distance; and C-reactive protein [CRP]), and exploratory endpoint (change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) were examined according to investigator-reported history of AF (yes/no). Responder analyses examined the proportions of patients who experienced a =5-, =10, =15, and =20-point improvement in KCCQ-CSS per history of AF.
RESULTS
: Of the 1,145 participants, 518 (45%) had a history of AF (40% paroxysmal, 24% persistent AF, and 35% permanent AF) and 627 (55%) did not. Participants with (vs without) AF were older, more often male, had higher NT-proBNP levels, included a higher proportion of those with NYHA functional class III symptoms, and used more antithrombotic therapies, beta-blockers, and diuretics. Semaglutide led to larger improvements in KCCQ-CSS (11.5 points [95% CI: 8.3-14.8] vs 4.3 points [95% CI: 1.3-7.2]; P interaction = 0.001) and the hierarchal composite endpoint (win ratio of 2.25 [95% CI: 1.79-2.83] vs 1.30 [95% CI: 1.06-1.59]; P interaction < 0.001) in participants with AF vs without AF, respectively. The proportions of patients receiving semaglutide vs those receiving placebo experiencing =5-, =10-, =15-, and =20-point improvement in KCCQ-CSS were also higher in those with (vs without) AF (all P interaction values <0.05). Semaglutide consistently reduced CRP, NT-proBNP, and body weight regardless of AF status (all P interaction values not significant). There were fewer serious adverse events and serious cardiac disorders in participants treated with semaglutide vs placebo irrespective of AF history.
CONCLUSIONS
: In the STEP-HFpEF Program, AF was observed in nearly one-half of patients with obesity-related HFpEF and was associated with several features of more advanced HF. Treatment with semaglutide led to significant improvements in HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function, as well as reductions in weight, CRP, and NT-proBNP in people with and without AF and across AF types. The magnitude of semaglutide-mediated improvements in HF-related symptoms and physical limitations was more pronounced in those with AF vs without AF at baseline.
