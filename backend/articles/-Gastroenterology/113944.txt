=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND & AIMS
: High-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been recommended to prevent rebleeding of high-risk peptic ulcer (PU) after hemostasis. Vonoprazan has been proven to be noninferior to PPIs in various acid-related diseases. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of vonoprazan vs PPI for preventing high-risk PU rebleeding after hemostasis.
METHODS
: A multicenter, randomized, noninferiority study was conducted in 6 centers. Pre-endoscopic and endoscopic therapy were performed according to standard protocol. After successful hemostasis, patients with high-risk PU bleeding (Forrest class Ia/Ib, IIa/IIb) were randomized into 1:1 to receive vonoprazan (20 mg twice a day for 3 days, then 20 mg once a day for 28 days) or high-dose PPI (pantoprazole intravenous infusion 8 mg/h for 3 days, then omeprazole 20 mg twice a day for 28 days). The primary outcome was a 30-day rebleeding rate. Secondary outcomes included 3- and 7-day rebleeding rate, all-cause and bleeding-related mortality, rate of rescue therapy, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, and safety.
RESULTS
: Of 194 patients, baseline characteristics, severity of bleeding, and stage of ulcers were comparable between the 2 groups. The 30-day rebleeding rates in vonoprazan and PPI groups were 7.1% (7 of 98) and 10.4% (10 of 96), respectively; noninferiority (within 10% margin) of vonoprazan to PPI was confirmed (%risk difference, -3.3; 95% confidence interval, -11.2 to 4.7; P < .001). The 3-day and 7-day rebleeding rates in the vonoprazan group remained noninferior to PPI (P < .001 by Farrington and Manning test). All secondary outcomes were also comparable between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION
: In patients with high-risk PU bleeding, the efficacy of vonoprazan in preventing 30-day rebleeding was noninferior to intravenous PPI. (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT05005910).
