=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Esophagectomy can be performed using various surgical techniques. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of surgery on long-term survival for esophageal cancer.
METHODS
: Between May 2010 and July 2012, 300 patients with esophageal cancer were randomly assigned to undergo esophagectomy with either a left or right thoracic approach. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared based on the per-protocol principle among 286 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma determined by postoperative pathologic results (146 in the right and 140 in the left thoracic arms).
RESULTS
: The median DFS was 92 months in the right thoracic arm and 41 months in the left thoracic arm (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.99; P = .045), with a cumulative 10-year DFS of 47.6% and 37.5%, respectively. The median OS was 136 months in the right thoracic arm and 99 months in the left thoracic arm (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.54-1.04; P = .081), with cumulative 10-year OS of 52.4% and 43.7%, respectively. DFS and OS were comparable between the 2 arms for patients without lymph node metastasis. Conversely, for patients with lymph node metastasis, 10-year DFS was 32.7% and 21.4%, respectively (P = .018), and 10-year OS of the right and left thoracic arms was 37.9% and 25.9%, respectively (P = .012).
CONCLUSIONS
: Compared with the left thoracic approach, patients who underwent esophagectomy through the right thoracic approach had better 10-year survival rates, and the survival benefit was significant for those with lymph node metastasis.
