=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVES
: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of early chest tube removal after anatomic pulmonary resection, regardless of the drainage volume.
METHODS
: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. Patients with greater than 300 mL drainage volume during postoperative day 1 were randomly assigned to group A (tube removed on postoperative day 2) and group B (tube retained until drainage volume =300 mL/24 hours). The primary end point was the frequency of respiratory-related adverse events (grade 2 or higher based on the Clavien-Dindo classification) within 30 days postoperatively.
RESULTS
: Between April 2019 and October 2021, 175 patients were assigned to group A (N = 88) or group B (N = 87). One patient in group B who experienced chylothorax was excluded from the study. Respiratory-related adverse events were observed in 10 patients (11.4%) in group A and 12 patients (14.0%) in group B (P = .008). The frequencies of thoracentesis or chest tube reinsertion were not significantly different (8.0% and 9.3% in groups A and B, respectively, P = .752). Additionally, the duration of chest tube placement was significantly shorter in group A than in group B (median, 2 vs 3 days; P < .001). No significant difference between groups A and B was found in postoperative hospital stay (median, 6 vs 7 days, P = .231).
CONCLUSIONS
: Early chest tube removal, regardless of drainage volume, was safe and feasible in patients who underwent anatomic pulmonary resection.
