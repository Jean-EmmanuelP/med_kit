=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of robotic techniques on organ transplantation outcomes.
BACKGROUND
: The evolution of organ transplantation is becoming influenced by the adoption of minimally invasive techniques, transitioning from laparoscopic to robotic methods. Robotic surgery has emerged as a significant advancement, providing superior precision and outcomes compared with traditional approaches.
METHODS
: This perspective includes a systematic review of the literature, original data from a high-volume center, as well as an international survey focusing on perceptions related to robotic versus laparoscopic and open approaches.
RESULTS
: The systematic review and meta-analysis revealed lower morbidity with robotic donor nephrectomy, recipient kidney transplant and donor hepatectomy. Our center's experience, with over 3000 minimally invasive transplant procedures (kidney, liver, donor, and recipient), supports the superiority of robotic transplant surgery (RTS). The global survey confirms this shift, revealing a preference for robotic approaches due to their reduced morbidity, despite challenges such as access to the robotic system and cost.
CONCLUSIONS
: This comprehensive overview including a systematic review, original data, and perceptions derived from the international survey demonstrate the superiority of robotic transplant surgery (RTS) across a range of organ transplantations, for both donors and recipients. The future of RTS depends on the efforts of the surgical community in addressing challenges such as economic implications, the need for specialized surgical training for numerous surgeons, as well as wide access to robotic systems worldwide.
