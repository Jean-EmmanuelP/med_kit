=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: At the first interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-671 trial, adding perioperative pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved event-free survival in participants with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report overall survival and health-related quality of life outcomes from the second interim analysis.
METHODS
: KEYNOTE-671 was a global phase 3 trial done at 189 medical centres. Eligible participants (aged =18 years) with resectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (N2) NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to four cycles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks) plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and 13 cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks) or to four cycles of neoadjuvant placebo (administered intravenously every 3 weeks) plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and 13 cycles of adjuvant placebo (administered intravenously every 3 weeks). Randomisation was done centrally using an interactive response technology system and was stratified by disease stage, PD-L1 expression, histology, and geographical region in blocks of four. Participants, investigators, and sponsor personnel were masked to treatment assignments; local pharmacists were unmasked to support treatment preparation. The dual primary endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival evaluated in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03425643, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment.
FINDINGS
: Between May 11, 2018, and Dec 15, 2021, 797 participants were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab group (n=397) or the placebo group (n=400). Median study follow-up at the second interim analysis was 36·6 months (IQR 27·6-47·8). 36-month overall survival estimates were 71% (95% CI 66-76) in the pembrolizumab group and 64% (58-69) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·72 [95% CI 0·56-0·93]; one-sided p=0·0052; threshold, one-sided p=0·0054). Median event-free survival was 47·2 months (95% CI 32·9 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group and 18·3 months (14·8-22·1) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·59 [95% CI 0·48-0·72]). In the as-treated population, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 179 (45%) of 396 participants in the pembrolizumab group and in 151 (38%) of 399 participants in the placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in four (1%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and three (1%) participants in the placebo group.
INTERPRETATION
: The significant overall survival benefit of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone coupled with a manageable safety profile support the use of perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC.
