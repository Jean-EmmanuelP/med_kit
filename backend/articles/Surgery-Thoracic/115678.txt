=== Abstract ===
Background: Pulmonary hypertension in children is progressive with wide variability in prognosis. This document provides an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel identified pertinent questions regarding the management of children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy, conducted systematic reviews of the relevant literature, and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to develop clinical recommendations. Results: After reviewing the research evidence, the panel considered the balance of desirable (benefits) and undesirable (harms and burdens) effects of the interventions in each proposed question. Valuation of our main outcomes was also considered, together with resources required, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Recommendations were developed for or against interventional strategies specific to children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy. Conclusions: Although there is a growing population of children with pulmonary hypertension, there is a striking lack of empirical evidence regarding management of those whose disease has progressed despite optimal pharmacotherapy. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for clinical recommendations for or against interventional strategies on the basis of this limited empirical evidence, coupled with expert opinion, to aid clinicians in the management of these complex pediatric patients. In addition, we identified important areas for future research.
