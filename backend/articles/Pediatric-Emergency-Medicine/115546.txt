=== Abstract ===
STUDY OBJECTIVE
: The peripheral intravenous catheter (IV) is the most common and painful invasive medical device in acute care settings. Our objective was to determine whether adding skin glue to secure IVs reduced catheter failure rate in children.
METHODS
: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in a tertiary-care pediatric emergency department (ED). ED patients younger than 18 years old with an IV who were anticipated to be admitted to hospital were eligible for enrollment. Children were randomized to receive standard IV securement with cloth-bordered transparent polyurethane dressing (control) or application of cyanoacrylate glue at the catheter insertion site in addition to standard securement (intervention). Participants were followed until device removal due to failure or physician order. The primary outcome was IV failure before the intended treatment course was complete. Patients who were randomized with primary outcome data were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
RESULTS
: Of the 557 participants enrolled between December 2020 and April 2023, 278 (50%) and 279 (50%) were allocated to the glue and control groups, respectively. A total of 527 participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Intravenous failure rates in the glue and control groups were 83 of 265 (31.3%) and 82 of 262 (31.3%), respectively. The odds of intravenous catheter failure were not different between groups (adjusted odds ratio 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 1.42). Time to device failure was similar between groups (hazard ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.35).
CONCLUSIONS
: This study found no benefit in using skin glue to secure IVs in the ED in children.
