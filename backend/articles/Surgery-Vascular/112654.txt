=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Up to 1% of adults will have a leg ulcer at some time. Most leg ulcers are venous in origin and are caused by high pressure in the veins due to blockage or damaged valves. Venous ulcer prevention and treatment typically involves the application of compression bandages/stockings to improve venous return and thus reduce pressure in the legs. Other treatment options involve removing or repairing veins. Most venous ulcers heal with compression therapy, but ulcer recurrence is common. For this reason, clinical guidelines recommend that people continue with compression treatment after their ulcer has healed. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and last updated in 2014.
OBJECTIVES
: To assess the effects of compression (socks, stockings, tights, bandages) for preventing recurrence of venous leg ulcers.
SEARCH METHODS
: In August 2023, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two ongoing trials registries. We also scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting.
SELECTION CRITERIA
: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated compression bandages or hosiery for preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
: At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Our primary outcome was reulceration (ulcer recurrence anywhere on the treated leg). Our secondary outcomes included duration of reulceration episodes, proportion of follow-up without ulcers, ulceration on the contralateral leg, noncompliance with compression therapy, comfort, and adverse effects. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology.
MAIN RESULTS
: We included eight studies (1995 participants), which were published between 1995 and 2019. The median study sample size was 249 participants. The studies evaluated different classes of compression (UK class 2 or 3 and European (EU) class 1, 2, or 3). Duration of follow-up ranged from six months to 10 years. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for risk of bias (lack of blinding), imprecision, and indirectness. EU class 3 compression stockings may reduce reulceration compared with no compression over six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.76; 1 study, 153 participants; low-certainty evidence). EU class 1 compression stockings compared with EU class 2 compression stockings may have little or no effect on reulceration over 12 months (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.32; 1 study, 99 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in rates of noncompliance over 12 months between people using EU class 1 stockings and people using EU class 2 stockings (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.75; 1 study, 99 participants; low-certainty evidence). UK class 2 hosiery compared with UK class 3 hosiery may be associated with a higher risk of reulceration over 18 months to 10 years (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.91; 5 studies, 1314 participants; low-certainty evidence). People who use UK class 2 hosiery may be more compliant with compression treatment than people who use UK class 3 hosiery over 18 months to 10 years (RR for noncompliance 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; 5 studies, 1372 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between Scholl UK class 2 compression stockings and Medi UK class 2 compression stockings in terms of reulceration (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.28; 1 study, 166 participants; low-certainty evidence) and noncompliance (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84.1 to 12; 1 study, 166 participants; low-certainty evidence) over 18 months. No studies compared different lengths of compression (e.g. below-knee versus above-knee), and no studies measured duration of reulceration episodes, ulceration on the contralateral leg, proportion of follow-up without ulcers, comfort, or adverse effects.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
: Compression with EU class 3 compression stockings may reduce reulceration compared with no compression over six months. Use of EU class 1 compression stockings compared with EU class 2 compression stockings may result in little or no difference in reulceration and noncompliance over 12 months. UK class 3 compression hosiery may reduce reulceration compared with UK class 2 compression hosiery; however, higher compression may lead to lower compliance. There may be little to no difference between Scholl and Medi UK class 2 compression stockings in terms of reulceration and noncompliance. There was no information on duration of reulceration episodes, ulceration on the contralateral leg, proportion of follow-up without ulcers, comfort, or adverse effects. More research is needed to investigate acceptable modes of long-term compression therapy for people at risk of recurrent venous ulceration. Future trials should consider interventions to improve compliance with compression treatment, as higher compression may result in lower rates of reulceration.
