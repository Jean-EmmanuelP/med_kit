=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Underutilization of therapies to reduce ischemic risk in peripheral artery disease (PAD) persists.
OBJECTIVES
: The purpose was to conduct an implementation trial of lipid management in vascular disease.
METHODS
: The OPTIMIZE PAD-1 (Implementation of Vascular Care Team to Improve Medical Management of PAD Patients) trial randomized patients with peripheral artery disease with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) =70 mg/dL to management via a vascular care team including a clinical pharmacist and an algorithm of intensive lipid management to achieve goal LDL-C in 1 step vs usual care plus provider education. Medications were obtained using commercial insurance. The primary endpoint was percent change in LDL-C at 12 months.
RESULTS
: Of 166 enrolled patients, 74.2% did not have an LDL-C level at goal. Among 114 randomized patients (mean age 66 years, 36.0% women, and 15.8% Black), 50.9% received high-intensity statin, and 7.9% received ezetimibe at baseline. The mean 12-month LDL-C change was -49.1% (95% CI: -58.7% to -39.5%) with vascular care team management and -5.4% (95% CI: -15.3% to 4.6%) with usual care; the between-group least-squares mean difference was -43.7% (95% CI: -57.6% to -29.9%; P < 0.0001). Mean LDL-C was reduced in vascular care team patients from 100.6 mg/dL at baseline to 54.8 and 50.1 mg/dL by week 4 and month 12, respectively. At 12 months, vascular care team patients were >3 times as likely to achieve LDL-C <70 mg/dL and 8 times as likely to achieve LDL-C <55 mg/dL (P < 0.0001) than usual care.
CONCLUSIONS
: OPTIMIZE PAD-1 showed that an interprofessional, algorithm-based program can achieve rapid LDL-C lowering in vascular patients using available insurance and therapies, and LDL-C targets can be met in most patients if enabled by optimized systems of care.
