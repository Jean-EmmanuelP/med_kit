=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND AND AIMS
: Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) presents a substantial disease burden, yet lifetime estimates remain scant. This nationwide study quantified the lifetime risk of PAD and its clinical outcomes in Denmark.
METHODS
: This cohort study included 4 275 631 individuals in Denmark aged 40-99 years between 1998 and 2018. We estimated the lifetime risk using a modified survival analysis method, considering death as a competing risk event.
RESULTS
: Over a median 15.5-year follow-up, 151 846 individuals were diagnosed with PAD (median age at diagnosis 71.5 years, interquartile range 63.1-79.2). The overall lifetime risk of PAD from age 40 was 11.6% (95% confidence interval 11.6%-11.7%), decreasing from 12.9% in 1998-2002 to 10.7% in 2013-18. Males had a higher lifetime risk than females (12.8% vs. 10.5%). Socioeconomic disparities were evident, with higher risks for those with lower educational levels (risk difference 3.4%, 95% confidence interval 3.2%-3.6%) and lower income (risk difference 0.4%, 95% confidence interval 0.2%-0.5%). One year after PAD diagnosis, 21.4% had undergone lower limb revascularization, 8.0% had experienced a major amputation, and 16.2% had died. At 5 years, the corresponding proportions were 26.4%, 10.8%, and 40.8%, respectively. The risk of lower limb revascularization showed little variation by sex and socioeconomic status, whereas there was a strong socioeconomic gradient for major amputation and all-cause death.
CONCLUSIONS
: More than one in 10 Danish individuals are diagnosed with symptomatic PAD during their lifetime. Peripheral arterial disease diagnosis is associated with high morbidity and mortality at 1 and 5 years.
