=== Abstract ===
IMPORTANCE
: Intermittent lower limb claudication limits function and quality of life. Supervised exercise programs are not readily available, and a noninvasive alternative is needed.
OBJECTIVE
: To assess extracorporeal corporeal shockwave therapy in improving quality of life in patients with claudication.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, patients in the outpatient setting at a single tertiary center for vascular surgery were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to extracorporeal shockwave therapy or placebo therapy with no shockwaves delivered. Recruitment was between June 2015 and January 2020, with 12-week follow-up ending in March 2020. A convenience sample of patients with claudication and conservative treatment requirements who refused or were unable to participate in supervised exercise were eligible. Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy or with an active cancer were excluded. Of 522 patients screened, 389 were eligible, 138 were enrolled, and 110 completed follow-up and were included in the primary analysis. Statistical analysis was completed by May 2021.
INTERVENTION
: In the intervention group, patients received 100 impulses of 0.1mJ/mm/cm2 in an area of the gastrocnemius muscle 3 times weekly for 3 weeks. The steps for treatment were replicated for the control group without delivering the treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
: The primary outcome was the Physical Functioning domain of the 36-item Short-Form Quality of Life Questionnaire at 12-week follow-up. Secondary outcomes included walking distances, ankle brachial pressure index, and other quality-of-life measures.
RESULTS
: Of 138 patients recruited and randomized, 92 (67%) were male, and the mean (SD) age of the study population was 67 (9.6) years. The intervention group had a significantly higher physical function score at 12 weeks (estimated median difference 3.8; 95% CI, 0.0-7.7; P = .03). However, this significance did not remain when adjusting for covariates. At 12 weeks, the intervention group had significantly longer pain-free and maximum walking distances (pain-free estimated median difference, 34.1, 95% CI, 11.4-56.8; P = .004; maximum estimated median difference, 51.4; 95% CI, 10.7-86.5; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
: To our knowledge, this is the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to consider extracorporeal shockwave therapy for the management of intermittent claudication. It demonstrated efficacy for walking distances, may have a positive effect on quality of life, and may provide a safe, noninvasive alternative therapy for patients with intermittent claudication.
