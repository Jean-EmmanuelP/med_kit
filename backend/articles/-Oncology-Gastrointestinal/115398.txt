=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND & AIMS
: Better surveillance tests for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are needed. The GALAD score (gender, age, a-fetoprotein [AFP] L3, AFP, and des-? carboxyprothrombin) has been shown to have excellent sensitivity and specificity for HCC in phase 2 studies. We performed a phase 3 biomarker validation study to compare GALAD with AFP in detecting HCC.
METHODS
: This is a prospective study of patients with cirrhosis enrolled at 7 centers. Surveillance for HCC was performed every 6 months at each site, and HCC diagnosis was confirmed per American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines. Blood for biomarker research was obtained at each follow-up visit and stored in a biorepository. Measurements of AFP, AFP-L3, and des-? carboxyprothrombin) were performed in a FujiFilm laboratory by staff blinded to clinical data. The performance of GALAD in detecting HCC was retrospectively evaluated within 12 months before the clinical diagnosis. All analyses were conducted by an unblinded statistician in the Early Detection Research Network data management and coordinating center.
RESULTS
: A total of 1,558 patients with cirrhosis were enrolled and followed for a median of 2.2 years. A total of 109 patients developed HCC (76 very early or early stage), with an annual incident rate of 2.4%. The areas under the curve for AFP and GALAD within 12 months before HCC were 0.66 and 0.78 (P < .001), respectively. Using a cutoff for GALAD of -1.36, the specificity was 82%, and the sensitivity at 12 months before HCC diagnosis was 62%. For comparison, performance of AFP at 82% specificity showed 41% sensitivity at 12 months before HCC diagnosis (P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS
: GALAD score, compared to AFP, improves the detection of HCC within 12 months before the actual diagnosis.
