=== Abstract ===
PURPOSE
: To assess the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in treating recurrent small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS
: In this trial, patients with recurrent small HCC (single lesion =5 cm) were randomly assigned to receive either SBRT or RFA. The primary end point was local progression-free survival (LPFS), and secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), local control rate, and safety.
RESULTS
: Between August 2019 and April 2022, 166 patients were assigned to SBRT (n = 83) and RFA (n = 83) groups. After a median follow-up time of 42.8 and 42.9 months in the SBRT and RFA groups, respectively, SBRT demonstrated a significantly better LPFS than that of RFA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.87]; P = .014). The 2-year LPFS rates were 92.7% (95% CI, 87.3 to 98.5) with SBRT and 75.8% (95% CI, 67.2 to 85.7) with RFA. The median PFS time of the SBRT and RFA groups was 37.6 (95% CI, 26.0 to 49.2) and 27.6 (95% CI, 20.3 to 34.8) months, respectively (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.50 to 1.15]; P = .190). Nine patients in the SBRT group and 10 in the RFA group died during the follow-up. The 2-year OS rates were 97.6% (95% CI, 94.3 to 100.0) in the SBRT group and 93.9% (95% CI, 88.9 to 99.2) in the RFA group (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.37 to 2.22]; P = .830). The incidences of both acute and late adverse events were comparable between the groups (P = .436 and P = .715, respectively).
CONCLUSION
: SBRT achieved better LPFS than that of RFA in patients with single recurrent HCC =5 cm, especially in HCC =2 cm, whereas PFS, OS, and safety were comparable between the two treatments.
