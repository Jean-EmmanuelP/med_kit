=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
: Atogepant is an oral, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist approved for the preventive treatment of migraine. We evaluated the efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine (CM) in participants with and without acute medication overuse.
METHODS
: This subgroup analysis of the phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled PROGRESS trial evaluated adults with a =1-year history of CM, =15 monthly headache days (MHDs), and =8 monthly migraine days (MMDs) during the 4-week baseline period. Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo, atogepant 30 mg twice daily (BID), or atogepant 60 mg once daily (QD) for 12 weeks and were analyzed by acute medication overuse status (triptans/ergots for =10 days per month, simple analgesics for =15 days per month, or combinations of triptans/ergots/simple analgesics for =10 days per month). Outcomes included change from baseline in mean MMDs, MHDs, and monthly acute medication use days; =50% reduction in mean MMDs across 12 weeks; and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.
RESULTS
: Of 755 participants in the modified intent-to-treat population, 500 (66.2%) met baseline acute medication overuse criteria (placebo, n = 169 [68.7%]; atogepant 30 mg BID, n = 161 [63.6%]; atogepant 60 mg QD, n = 170 [66.4%]). The least squares mean difference (LSMD) (95% CI) from placebo in MMDs was -2.7 (-4.0 to -1.4) with atogepant 30 mg BID and -1.9 (-3.2 to -0.6) with atogepant 60 mg QD. Mean MHDs (LSMD [95% CI] -2.8 [-4.0 to -1.5] and -2.1 [-3.3 to -0.8]) and mean acute medication use days (LSMD [95% CI] -2.8 [-4.1 to -1.6] and -2.6 [-3.9 to -1.3]) were reduced and a higher proportion of participants achieved =50% reduction in MMDs (odds ratio [95% CI] 2.5 [1.5-4.0] and 2.3 [1.4-3.7]) with atogepant 30 mg BID and atogepant 60 mg QD. There was a 52.1%-61.9% reduction in the proportion of atogepant-treated participants meeting acute medication overuse criteria over 12 weeks. Atogepant improved PRO measures. Similar results were observed in the subgroup without acute medication overuse.
DISCUSSION
: Atogepant was effective in participants with CM, with and without acute medication overuse, as evidenced by reductions in mean MMDs, MHDs, and acute medication use days; reductions in the proportion of participants meeting acute medication overuse criteria; and improvements in PROs.

CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE
: This study provides Class II evidence that atogepant reduces mean MMDs, MHDs, and monthly acute medication use days in adult patients with or without medication overuse.
