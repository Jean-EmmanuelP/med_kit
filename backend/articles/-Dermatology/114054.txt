=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Atopic dermatitis (eczema), can have a significant impact on well-being and quality of life for affected people and their families. Standard treatment is avoidance of triggers or irritants and regular application of emollients and topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Thorough physical and psychological assessment is central to good-quality treatment. Overcoming barriers to provision of holistic treatment in dermatological practice is dependent on evaluation of the efficacy and economics of both psychological and educational interventions in this participant group. This review is based on a previous Cochrane review published in 2014, and now includes adults as well as children.
OBJECTIVES
: To assess the clinical outcomes of educational and psychological interventions in children and adults with atopic dermatitis (eczema) and to summarise the availability and principal findings of relevant economic evaluations.
SEARCH METHODS
: We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO and two trials registers up to March 2023. We checked the reference lists of included studies and related systematic reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. We searched NHS Economic Evaluation Database, MEDLINE and Embase for economic evaluations on 8 June 2022.
SELECTION CRITERIA
: Randomised, cluster-randomised and cross-over RCTs that assess educational and psychological interventions for treating eczema in children and adults.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
: We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes were reduction in disease severity, as measured by clinical signs, patient-reported symptoms and improvement in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) measures. Secondary outcomes were improvement in long-term control of symptoms, improvement in psychological well-being, improvement in standard treatment concordance and adverse events. We assessed short- (up to 16 weeks after treatment) and long-term time points (more than 16 weeks).
MAIN RESULTS
: We included 37 trials (6170 participants). Most trials were conducted in high-income countries (34/37), in outpatient settings (25/37). We judged three trials to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifteen trials had a high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to bias in measurement of the outcome. Trials assessed interventions compared to standard care. Individual educational interventions may reduce short-term clinical signs (measured by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD); mean difference (MD) -5.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.39 to -2.01; 1 trial, 30 participants; low-certainty evidence) but patient-reported symptoms, HRQoL, long-term eczema control and psychological well-being were not reported. Group education interventions probably reduce clinical signs (SCORAD) both in the short term (MD -9.66, 95% CI -19.04 to -0.29; 3 studies, 731 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and the long term (MD -7.22, 95% CI -11.01 to -3.43; 3 studies, 1424 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably reduce long-term patient-reported symptoms (SMD -0.47 95% CI -0.60 to -0.33; 2 studies, 908 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may slightly improve short-term HRQoL (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.01; 4 studies, 746 participants; low-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to short-term psychological well-being (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); MD -2.47, 95% CI -5.16 to 0.22; 1 study, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). Long-term eczema control was not reported. We don't know whether technology-mediated educational interventions could improve short-term clinical signs (SCORAD; 1 study; 29 participants; very low-certainty evidence). They may have little or no effect on short-term patient-reported symptoms (Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM); MD -0.76, 95% CI -1.84 to 0.33; 2 studies; 195 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably have little or no effect on short-term HRQoL (MD 0, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03; 2 studies, 430 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Technology-mediated education interventions probably slightly improve long-term eczema control (Recap of atopic eczema (RECAP); MD -1.5, 95% CI -3.13 to 0.13; 1 study, 232 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may improve short-term psychological well-being (MD -1.78, 95% CI -2.13 to -1.43; 1 study, 24 participants; low-certainty evidence). Habit reversal treatment may reduce short-term clinical signs (SCORAD; MD -6.57, 95% CI -13.04 to -0.1; 1 study, 33 participants; low-certainty evidence) but we are uncertain about any effects on short-term HRQoL (Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI); 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Patient-reported symptoms, long-term eczema control and psychological well-being were not reported. We are uncertain whether arousal reduction therapy interventions could improve short-term clinical signs (Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI); 1 study, 24 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or patient-reported symptoms (visual analogue scale (VAS); 1 study, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Arousal reduction therapy may improve short-term HRQoL (Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI); MD -2.1, 95% CI -4.41 to 0.21; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence) and psychological well-being (PSS; MD -1.2, 95% CI -3.38 to 0.98; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence). Long-term eczema control was not reported. No studies reported standard care compared with self-help psychological interventions, psychological therapies or printed education; or adverse events. We identified two health economic studies. One found that a 12-week, technology-mediated, educational-support programme may be cost neutral. The other found that a nurse practitioner group-education intervention may have lower costs than standard care provided by a dermatologist, with comparable effectiveness.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
: In-person, individual education, as an adjunct to conventional topical therapy, may reduce short-term eczema signs compared to standard care, but there is no information on eczema symptoms, quality of life or long-term outcomes. Group education probably reduces eczema signs and symptoms in the long term and may also improve quality of life in the short term. Favourable effects were also reported for technology-mediated education, habit reversal treatment and arousal reduction therapy. All favourable effects are of uncertain clinical significance, since they may not exceed the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the outcome measures used (MCID 8.7 points for SCORAD, 3.4 points for POEM). We found no trials of self-help psychological interventions, psychological therapies or printed education. Future trials should include more diverse populations, address shared priorities, evaluate long-term outcomes and ensure patients are involved in trial design.
