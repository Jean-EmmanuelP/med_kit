=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Two pre-erythrocytic vaccines (R21/Matrix-M and RTS,S/AS01) are now approved for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, neither induces blood-stage immunity against parasites that break through from the liver. RH5.1/Matrix-M, a blood-stage P falciparum malaria vaccine candidate, was highly immunogenic in Tanzanian adults and children. We therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of RH5.1/Matrix-M in Burkinabe children.
METHODS
: In this double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2b trial, RH5.1/Matrix-M was given to children aged 5-17 months in Nanoro, Burkina Faso, a seasonal malaria transmission setting. Children received either three intramuscular vaccinations with 10 µg RH5.1 protein with 50 µg Matrix-M adjuvant or three doses of rabies control vaccine, Rabivax-S, given either in a delayed third-dose (0, 1, and 5 month) regimen (first cohort) or a 0, 1, and 2 month regimen (second cohort). Vaccinations were completed part way through the malaria season. Children were randomly assigned 2:1 within each cohort to receive RH5.1/Matrix-M or Rabivax-S. Participants were assigned according to a random allocation list generated by an independent statistician using block randomisation with variable block sizes. Participants, their families, and the study teams were masked to group allocation; only pharmacists who prepared the vaccines were unmasked. Vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy were evaluated. The coprimary outcomes assessed were: first, the safety and reactogenicity of RH5.1/Matrix-M; and second, the protective efficacy of RH5.1/Matrix-M against clinical malaria (measured as time to first episode of clinical malaria, using a Cox regression model) from 14 days to 6 months after the third vaccination in the per-protocol sample. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05790889).
FINDINGS
: From April 6 to 13 and July 3 to 7, 2023, 412 children aged 5-17 months were screened, and 51 were excluded. A total of 361 children were enrolled in this study. In the first cohort, 119 were assigned to the RH5.1/Matrix-M delayed third-dose group, and 62 to the equivalent rabies control group. The second cohort included 120 children in the monthly RH5.1/Matrix-M group and 60 in the equivalent rabies control group. The final vaccination was administered to all groups from Sept 4 to 21, 2023. RH5.1/Matrix-M in both cohorts had a favourable safety profile and was well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild, with the most common being local swelling and fever. No serious adverse events were reported. Comparing the RH5.1/Matrix-M delayed third-dose regimen with the pooled control groups resulted in a vaccine efficacy of 55% (95% CI 20 to 75%; p=0·0071). The same analysis showed a vaccine efficacy of 40% (-3 to 65%; p=0·066) when comparing the monthly regimen with the pooled control groups. Participants vaccinated with RH5.1/Matrix-M in both cohorts showed high concentrations of anti-RH5.1 serum IgG antibodies 14 days after the third vaccination, and the purified IgG showed high levels of in vitro growth inhibition activity against P falciparum; these responses were higher in patients who received the RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccine delayed third-dose regimen, as opposed to monthly regimen (growth inhibition activity 79·0% [SD 14·3] vs 74·2% [SD 15·9]; p=0·016).
INTERPRETATION
: RH5.1/Matrix-M appears safe and highly immunogenic in African children and shows promising efficacy against clinical malaria when given in a delayed third-dose regimen. This trial is ongoing to further monitor efficacy over time.
