=== Abstract ===
OBJECTIVE
: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) combined with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) achieves better glycemic control than multi-injection therapy in people with type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of closed-loop therapy needs to be further evaluated in this population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
: The study objective was to measure the impact of a hybrid closed-loop device (DBLG1) compared with CSII + CGM on glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes previously treated with CSII. The randomized, controlled, crossover, two-period, open-label, and multicenter study was conducted from August 2022 to July 2023 in 17 individuals (9 to receive 6 weeks of CSII + CGM first and 8 to receive 6 weeks of closed-loop therapy first). The primary end point was the percentage time in range (TIR: 70-180 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes were other CGM-glucose metrics, physical activity, and sleep objectively measured using 1-week actimetry.
RESULTS
: Data were analyzed using a modified intention-to-treat approach. Mean age was 63 (SD 9) years and 35% were women. Mean HbA1c at inclusion was 7.9% (SD 0.9). TIR increased to 76.0% (interquartile range 69.0-84.0) during the closed-loop condition vs. 61.0% (interquartile range 55.0-70.0) during the CSII + CGM condition; mean difference was 15.0 percentage points (interquartile range 8.0-22.0; P < 0.001). Analyses of secondary end points showed a decrease in time above range, in glucose management indicator, in glucose variability, and an increase in daily insulin dose. Actimetric sleep analysis showed an improvement in sleep fragmentation during closed-loop treatment.
CONCLUSIONS
: Closed-loop therapy improved glycemic control more than did CSII + CGM in people with type 2 diabetes.
