=== Abstract ===
AIMS
: The study aims to examine the outcome of replacement of prandial insulin with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes reasonably controlled on multiple daily insulin injections (MDI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
: This single-centre, randomised, open-label trial enrolled a statistically predetermined sample of 60 adults with HbA1c =7.5% (58 mmol/mol) receiving MDI, with a total daily dose (TDD) =120 units/day. Participants were assigned 2:1 to subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0 mg plus insulin degludec, or to continue MDI. The primary outcome was percentage of subjects maintaining HbA1c =7.5% (58 mmol/mol) at Week 26.
RESULTS
: At Week 26, 90% of semaglutide and 75% of MDI subjects maintained HbA1c =7.5% (=58 mmol/mol) (p = 0.18). Mean changes (95% CI) in HbA1c, weight and percentage body weight for semaglutide versus MDI, respectively, were -0.5% (-0.7, -0.3) versus 0.0% (-0.3, 0.3; p = 0.009); -8.9 kg (-9.9, -7.8) versus 1.5 kg (-0.1, 3.1; p < 0.001); and -8.6% (-9.6, -7.6) versus 1.4% (0.0, 2.8; p < 0.001). Insulin TDD decreased 56.0% (-62.3, -49.7) with semaglutide and increased 6.7% (-2.5, 16.0) with MDI (p < 0.001). Among semaglutide subjects, 58% reduced insulin TDD > 50%, 97.5% stopped prandial insulin and 45% lost >10% body weight. Participant treatment satisfaction scores trended higher with semaglutide. Hypoglycaemia frequency was similar between groups.
CONCLUSIONS
: In people with type 2 diabetes well controlled (HbA1c =7.5% [=58 mmol/mol]) on MDI =120 units/day, replacing multiple daily injections of prandial insulin with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide can maintain and even improve HbA1c, lower body weight and lessen the burden of management.
