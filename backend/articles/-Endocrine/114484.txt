=== Abstract ===
AIM
: To assess the effects of vitamin D interventions on glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
METHODS
: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies. Serum 25(OH)D, fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, fasting insulin and Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were analysed.
RESULTS
: We identified 39 randomized controlled trials involving 2982 subjects. Results showed a significant decline in the vitamin D group, as shown by the FBG weighted mean difference (WMD; -0.49 [95% confidence interval {CI}: -0.69 to -0.28] mmol/L), HbA1c (WMD -0.30% [95% CI: -0.43 to -0.18]), HOMA-IR (WMD -0.39 [95% CI -0.64 to -0.14]) and insulin (WMD -1.31 [95% CI: -2.06 to -0.56] µIU/mL). Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control depend on the dosage and duration of supplementation, baseline 25(OH)D levels and the body mass index of patients with T2D.
CONCLUSIONS
: Vitamin D supplementation can significantly reduce serum FBG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels in T2D patients; the effects were especially prominent when vitamin D was given in a short-term, high dosage to patients with a vitamin D deficiency, who were overweight, or had an HbA1c of 8% or higher at baseline. Our study suggests that vitamin D supplements can be recommended as complementary treatment for T2D patients.
