=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the leading inherited cause of kidney disease. Clinical management has historically focused on symptom control and reducing associated complications. Improved understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in kidney cyst growth and disease progression has resulted in new pharmaceutical agents targeting disease pathogenesis and preventing disease progression. However, the role of disease-modifying agents for all people with ADPKD is unclear. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.
OBJECTIVES
: We aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent the progression of ADPKD and the safety based on patient-important endpoints, defined by the Standardised Outcomes in NephroloGy-Polycystic Kidney Disease (SONG-PKD) core outcome set, and general and specific adverse effects.
SEARCH METHODS
: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies up to 13 August 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
SELECTION CRITERIA
: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any interventions for preventing the progression of ADPKD with other interventions, placebo, or standard care were considered for inclusion.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
: Two authors independently assessed study risks of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
MAIN RESULTS
: We included 57 studies (8016 participants) that investigated 18 pharmacological interventions (vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) antagonists, antihypertensive therapy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, somatostatin analogues, antiplatelet agents, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins, kinase inhibitors, diuretics, anti-diabetic agents, water intake, dietary intervention, and supplements) in this review. Compared to placebo, the V2R antagonist tolvaptan probably preserves eGFR (3 studies, 2758 participants: MD 1.26 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.78; I2 = 0%) and probably slows total kidney volume (TKV) growth in adults (1 study, 1307 participants: MD -2.70 mL/cm, 95% CI -3.24 to -2.16) (moderate certainty evidence). However, there was insufficient evidence to determine tolvaptan's impact on kidney failure and death. There may be no difference in serious adverse events; however, treatment probably increases nocturia, fatigue and liver enzymes, may increase dry mouth and thirst, and may decrease hypertension and urinary and upper respiratory tract infections. Data on the impact of other therapeutic interventions were largely inconclusive. Compared to placebo, somatostatin analogues probably decrease TKV (6 studies, 500 participants: SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.16; I2 = 11%), probably have little or no effect on eGFR (4 studies, 180 participants: MD 4.11 mL/min/1.73 m3, 95% CI -3.19 to 11.41; I2 = 0%) (moderate certainty evidence), and may have little or no effect on kidney failure (2 studies, 405 participants: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.49; I2 = 39%; low certainty evidence). Serious adverse events may increase (2 studies, 405 participants: RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.25; low certainty evidence). Somatostatin analogues probably increase alopecia, diarrhoea or abnormal faeces, dizziness and fatigue but may have little or no effect on anaemia or infection. The effect on death is unclear. Targeted low blood pressure probably results in a smaller per cent annual increase in TKV (1 study, 558 participants: MD -1.00, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.33; moderate certainty evidence) compared to standard blood pressure targets, had uncertain effects on death, but probably do not impact other outcomes such as change in eGFR or adverse events. Kidney failure was not reported. Data comparing antihypertensive agents, mTOR inhibitors, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins, vitamin D compounds, metformin, trichlormethiazide, spironolactone, bosutinib, curcumin, niacinamide, prescribed water intake and antiplatelet agents were sparse and inconclusive. An additional 23 ongoing studies were also identified, including larger phase III RCTs, which will be assessed in a future update of this review.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
: Although many interventions have been investigated in patients with ADPKD, at present, there is little evidence that they improve patient outcomes. Tolvaptan is the only therapeutic intervention that has demonstrated the ability to slow disease progression, as assessed by eGFR and TKV change. However, it has not demonstrated benefits for death or kidney failure. In order to confirm the role of other therapeutic interventions in ADPKD management, large RCTs focused on patient-centred outcomes are needed. The search identified 23 ongoing studies, which may provide more insight into the role of specific interventions.
