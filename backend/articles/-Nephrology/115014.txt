=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND
: GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors both improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on clinical outcomes with and without SGLT2 inhibitors.
METHODS
: We searched MEDLINE and Embase databases from inception until July 12, 2024, for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outcome trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes that reported treatment effects by baseline use of SGLT2 inhibitors, with findings supplemented by unpublished data. We estimated treatment effects by baseline SGLT2 inhibitor use using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. The main cardiovascular outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) and hospitalization for heart failure. Kidney outcomes included a composite of =50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, kidney failure or death caused by kidney failure, and annualized rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate slope). Serious adverse events and severe hypoglycemia were also evaluated. This meta-analysis was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42024565765).
RESULTS
: We identified 3 trials with 1743 of 17 072 (10.2%) participants with type 2 diabetes receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor at baseline. GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 21% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71-0.87]), with consistent effects in those receiving and not receiving SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.54-1.09] and HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71-0.87], respectively; P-heterogeneity=0.78). The effect on hospitalization for heart failure was similarly consistent regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36-0.93] and HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63-0.85]; P-heterogeneity=0.26). Effects on the composite kidney outcome (risk ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.95]) and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope (0.78 mL/min/1.73 m2/y [95% CI, 0.57-0.98]) also did not vary according to SGLT2 inhibitor use (P-heterogeneity=0.53 and 0.94, respectively). Serious adverse effects and severe hypoglycemia were also similar regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use (P-heterogeneity=0.29 and 0.50, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
: In people with type 2 diabetes, the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists are consistent regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use.
