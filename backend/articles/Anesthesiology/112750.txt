=== Abstract ===
PURPOSE
: Anesthesiologists can use supraglottic airway devices as a rescue technique for failed intubation even in patients with an increased risk of gastric regurgitation. In this randomized study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of cricoid pressure and paratracheal pressure on placement of the i-gel® (Intersurgical Ltd., Wokingham, Berkshire, UK).
METHODS
: After induction of anesthesia in 76 adult patients, we inserted the i-gel under paratracheal or cricoid pressure, and assessed the success rate of i-gel insertion, resistance during insertion, time required for insertion, accuracy of the insertion location, tidal volumes, and peak inspiratory pressure with or without each maneuver after i-gel insertion.
RESULTS
: The overall success rate of insertion was significantly higher under paratracheal pressure than under cricoid pressure (36/38 [95%] vs 27/38 [71%], respectively; difference, 24%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8 to 40; P = 0.006]. Resistance during insertion was significantly lower under paratracheal pressure than under cricoid pressure (P < 0.001). The time required for insertion was significantly shorter under paratracheal pressure than under cricoid pressure (median [interquartile range], 18 [15-23] sec vs 28 [22-38] sec, respectively; difference in medians, -10; 95% CI, -18 to -4; P < 0.001). Fibreoptic examination of the anatomical alignment of the i-gel in the larynx revealed no significant difference in the accuracy of the insertion location between the two maneuvers (P = 0.31). The differences in tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressure with or without the maneuvers were significantly lower with paratracheal pressure than with cricoid pressure (P = 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
: Insertion of the i-gel supraglottic airway was significantly more successful, easier, and faster while applying paratracheal pressure than cricoid pressure.
