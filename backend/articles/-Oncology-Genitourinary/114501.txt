=== Abstract ===
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
: Time to testosterone recovery (TR) following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists varies widely. We evaluate TR kinetics and the oncological impact of an effective castration period in patients receiving definitive radiotherapy and ADT for prostate cancer.
METHODS
: We obtained individual patient data from randomized controlled trials of radiotherapy with ADT and prospectively collected serial testosterone data from the MARCAP Consortium. We estimated the times to noncastrate TR (>1.7 nmol/l) and nonhypogonadal TR (>8.0 nmol/l) were estimated for each prescribed ADT duration, and developed corresponding nomograms. The association between effective castration period and metastasis-free survival (MFS) for any given ADT duration was evaluated via multivariable Cox regression. We conducted cubic spline analyses to assess nonlinear associations.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS
: We included 1444 men from five trials in the analysis, of whom 115 received 4 mo, 880 received 6 mo, 353 received 18 mo, 36 received 28 mo, and 60 received 36 mo of ADT. Times to noncastrate TR and to nonhypogonadal TR varied considerably by ADT duration. Higher baseline testosterone and lower age were associated with a higher likelihood of TR (p < 0.001 for both). Effective castration period was not linearly associated with MFS for any ADT duration on Cox regression. Cubic spline analysis revealed that the optimal effective castration period for an MFS benefit was 10.6 mo for men who received 6 mo of ADT and 18 mo for men who received 18 mo of ADT.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
: Time to TR varies according to the ADT duration, baseline testosterone, and age. The relationship between effective castration period and MFS may be nonlinear, with a longer effective castration period being helpful for men receiving 6 mo of ADT.
