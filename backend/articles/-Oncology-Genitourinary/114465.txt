=== Abstract ===
PURPOSE
: CheckMate 914 is a two-part, randomized phase III trial evaluating adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab (part A) or adjuvant nivolumab monotherapy (part B) versus placebo in mutually exclusive populations of patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at high risk of postnephrectomy recurrence. Part A showed no disease-free survival (DFS) benefit for adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus placebo. We report results from part B.
METHODS
: Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) to nivolumab (240 mg once every 2 weeks for up to 12 doses), placebo, or nivolumab (240 mg once every 2 weeks for up to 12 doses) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg once every 6 weeks for up to four doses). The planned treatment duration was 24 weeks (approximately 5.5 months). The primary end point was DFS per blinded independent central review (BICR) for nivolumab versus placebo; safety was a secondary end point.
RESULTS
: Overall, 825 patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab (n = 411), placebo (n = 208), or nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n = 206). With a median follow-up of 27.0 months (range, 18.0-42.4), the primary end point of improved DFS per BICR with nivolumab versus placebo was not met (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.21]; P = .40); the median DFS was not reached in either arm, and 18-month DFS rates were 78.4% versus 75.4%. The HR for DFS per investigator was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.12; P = .19). Grade 3-4 all-cause adverse events (AEs) occurred in 17.2%, 15.0%, and 28.9% of patients with nivolumab, placebo, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab, respectively. Any-grade treatment-related AEs led to discontinuation in 9.6%, 1.0%, and 28.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSION
: Part B of CheckMate 914 did not meet the primary end point of improved DFS for nivolumab versus placebo in patients with localized RCC at high risk of postnephrectomy recurrence.
