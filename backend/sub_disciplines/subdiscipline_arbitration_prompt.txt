You are acting as an arbiter for a medical literature sub-discipline classification task. Two previous analyses of the abstract resulted in potentially conflicting lists of relevant sub-disciplines chosen from the provided candidate list.

Previous Results:
- First Analysis Result (JSON List): {result1}
- Second Analysis Result (JSON List): {result2}

**Your Task:**

1.  Carefully re-read the abstract provided below.
2.  Re-evaluate which sub-disciplines from the candidate list are the **most direct and primary focus** of the research described in the abstract.
3.  Consider the two previous results.
4.  Determine the **single, final, most accurate list** of sub-disciplines.
5.  If the abstract discusses topics generally relevant to the overall discipline(s) but does **not** clearly fit into any of the *specific* sub-disciplines listed, the correct result is an empty list.
6.  **Output ONLY the final, most accurate list as a JSON formatted list of strings.** Example: `["Cardiology", "Interventional Radiology"]` or `[]`.

**Candidate Sub-disciplines:**
---
{sub_discipline_list}
---

**Abstract to Evaluate:**
---
{abstract_text}
---

Your Final JSON Output (List of selected sub-discipline names):
+ Example Valid Output 1: ["Hematology"]
+ Example Valid Output 2: []
